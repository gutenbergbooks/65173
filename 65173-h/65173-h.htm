<h1 class="nobreak">MIGRATION
of BIRDS</h1>
</div>


<p>When the birds that have nested in our dooryards and those that
have frequented the neighboring woods, hills, and marshes leave us in
the fall, the question naturally comes to mind: Where do they go?
This, however, is only one small part of the question as we also wonder:
Will the same ones return next spring to their former haunts? What
dangers will they face on their round-trip flight and while in their
winter homes? These and other questions on the migratory habits
of most species of Northern Hemisphere birds puzzle all who are
interested in them, whether it be the farmer who profits by their
tireless warfare against the weed and insect pests of his crops, the bird
student who enjoys an abundance and variety of feathered inhabitants
about him, or the hunter who wants a continuation from year to year
of the sport of wildfowling. Lack of information on the subject may
mean the loss of an important resource by unconsciously letting it slip
from us, as ignorance might be responsible for inadequate legal protection
for such species as might urgently need it. More general
knowledge on the subject will aid in the perpetuation of the various
migrants, the seasonal habitats of some of which are in grave danger
from man's utilization, sometimes unwisely, of the marsh, water and
other areas that were formerly homes for birds.</p>

<p>The migrations of birds were probably among the first natural phenomena
to attract the attention and intrigue the imagination of man.
Recorded observations on the subject date back nearly 3,000 years, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">-2-</span>
the times of Hesiod, Homer, Herodotus, Aristotle, and others. In the
Bible there are several references to the periodic movements of birds,
as in the Book of Job (39:26), where the inquiry is made: "Doth the
hawk fly by Thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south?"
Jeremiah (8:7), wrote: "The stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed
time; and the turtle [dove], and the crane, and the swallow,
observe the time of their coming." And the flight of quail that saved
the Israelites from starvation in their wanderings in the wilderness of
Sinai is now recognized as a vast movement of migratory quail between
their breeding grounds and their winter home in Africa.</p>

<p>Throughout the ages the return flights of migratory birds have been
important as a source of food after a lean winter and as the harbinger
of a change in season. The arrival of certain species has been heralded
with appropriate ceremonies in many lands, and among the Eskimos
and other tribes the phenomenon to this day is the accepted sign of the
imminence of spring and of warmer weather. The pioneer fur traders
in Alaska and Canada offered rewards to the Indian or Eskimo who
saw the first goose of the spring, and all joined in jubilant welcome to
the newcomer.</p>

<p>As the North American Continent became more thickly settled, the
large flocks of ducks and geese that always had been hunted for food
became objects of the enthusiastic attention of an increasing army of
sportsmen. Most of the nongame species were found to be valuable
also as allies of the farmer in his never-ending warfare against weed
and insect pests. The need for laws protecting the valuable game and
nongame birds and for regulating the hunting of the diminishing game
species followed as a natural course. In the management of this wildlife
resource it has become obvious that continuous studies must be
made of the food habits of the various species, their environmental
needs, and their travels. Hence bird investigations are made by the
Fish and Wildlife Service, the bureau charged by Congress under the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act with the duty of protecting those species
that in their yearly journeys pass back and forth between the United
States and Canada, and between the United States and Mexico.</p>

<p>For more than half a century the Fish and Wildlife Service and
its predecessor, the Biological Survey, have been collecting data on
the interesting and important phenomenon of the migration of North
American birds. The field men of the Service have gathered information
concerning the distribution and seasonal movements of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">-3-</span>
different species in many extended areas, from the Arctic coast south
to the pampas of Argentina. Supplementing these investigations is
the work of hundreds of volunteer ornithologists and bird students
throughout the United States and Canada, who each year, spring and
fall, forward to the Service reports on the migrations as observed in
their respective localities. Added to the mass of data thus assembled
is a rapidly growing recovery file of marked individuals. These data,
together with other carded records gleaned by the Fish and Wildlife
Service from a vast literature, constitute a series of files that now contain
well over 3,000,000 entries, easily the greatest existing accumulation
of information pertaining to the distribution and movements of North
American birds. Not only do the facts thus assembled form the basis
of regulatory action for the protection of the birds, but they also make
it possible to publish scientific accounts of the ranges and migrations
of the different species. They furnish the basis of this bulletin.</p>

<p>The several important bird-protective measures adopted by State
and Federal Governments, particularly those having as their objectives
the conservation of the migratory song, insectivorous, and game species,
can be effective only if they have intelligent public support. To
increase such support, information must be more generally available
on that little understood but universally fascinating subject of bird
migration. A brief presentation of facts on the migratory habits of
the birds scientifically gathered by the Fish and Wildlife Service over
many years, will be helpful to bird-study classes, to conservation organizations,
and to farmers and others individually interested in the
welfare of the birds.</p>

<p>In addition to his original investigations in the field and in the files
of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the author has made free use of the
writings of many other students of the subject. To all of these grateful
acknowledgment is made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Mystery_of_Migration"><i>The Mystery of Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Of observers whose writings are extant, Aristotle, naturalist and
philosopher of ancient Greece, was one of the first to discuss the
subject of bird migration. He noted that cranes traveled from the
steppes of Scythia to the marshes at the headwaters of the Nile, and
that pelicans, geese, swans, rails, doves, and many other birds likewise
passed to warmer regions to spend the winter. In the earliest years of
the Christian era, the elder Pliny, Roman naturalist, in his Historia
Naturalis, repeated much of what Aristotle had said on migration and
added comments of his own concerning the movements of the European
blackbird, the starling, and the thrushes.</p>

<p>In spite of the keen perception shown in some of his statements
Aristotle also must be credited with the origin of some superstitious
beliefs that persisted for several centuries. One of these, that of
hibernation, became so firmly rooted that Dr. Elliott Coues (1878),<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
one of America's greatest ornithologists, listed the titles of no less than
182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. The hibernation
theory accounted for the autumnal disappearance of certain species
of birds by having them pass into a torpid state and so remain during
the cold season, hidden in hollow trees, caves, or in the mud of marshes.
Aristotle ascribed hibernation not only to swallows, but also to storks,
kites, doves, and others. Some early naturalists wrote fantastic accounts
of the flocks of swallows that allegedly were seen congregating
in the marshes until their accumulated weight bent into the water the
reeds on which they clung and thus submerged the birds. It was even
recorded that when fishermen in northern waters drew up their nets
they sometimes had a mixed "catch" of fish and hibernating swallows.
Clarke (1912) quotes Olaus Magnus, Archbishop of Upsala, who in
1555 published a work entitled "Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalis
et Natura," wherein he observed that if swallows so caught were taken
into a warm room they would soon begin to fly about but would live
only a short time.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Publications referred to parenthetically by date are listed
in the <a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography, p. 94</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>The hibernation theory survived for more than 2,000 years and, until
the winter home of the chimney swift was discovered in 1944 through
the recovery of banded individuals, it was occasionally repeated by
credulous persons to account for the sudden disappearance of the immense
flocks that each autumn gather in southern Georgia and northern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">-5-</span>
Florida. Although the winter range is still unknown in fullest
detail, Lincoln (1944b) has shown that some of these birds spend the
winter season in northeastern Peru.</p>

<p>Although the idea that hibernation is a regular feature of the life
cycle of birds is no longer accepted for any species, recognition must be
accorded the observations of Edmund C. Jaeger of Riverside College,
Riverside, Calif. (1949). Earlier (1948), he had given a brief account
of the behavior of a poor-will found during the winter of 1946-47 in
the Chukawalla Mountains of the Colorado Desert, Calif., and which
was in a state of profound torpidity.</p>

<p>What was presumably the same individual was found in the same
rock niche in a comatose condition on November 26, 1947. Beginning
on December 30, 1947, rectal temperatures were taken every 2 weeks,
the last on February 14, 1948. The temperature dropped from 67.6&deg;
on the first date to 64.4&deg; on January 18 and February 1, recovering to
65.8&deg; on the late date of record. The weight decreased from 45.61
grams on January 4 to 44.56 grams on February 14. An attempt to
detect heart beat by the use of a medical stethoscope was negative. No
movement of the chest walls could be detected and no moisture could be
collected on a cold mirror placed in front of the nostrils. Strong
light aimed directly into the pupil resulted in no response, not even an
attempt to close the eyelid. No waste matter was passed during the
entire period of observation and all evidence indicated that the bird
was in an exceedingly low state of metabolism.</p>

<p>This bird was banded on January 5, 1948, with a Service band and
was back in the same rock niche on November 24, 1948, certainly the
second and probably the third season of return to this exact point. It
was there on December 5, 1948, but 2 weeks later it had disappeared,
probably the victim of some predator or an inquisitive human. Professor
Jaeger reports that the Hopi Indians call the poor-will
"Holchko," the sleeping one.</p>

<p>Aristotle also was the originator of the theory of transmutation,
basing it upon the fact that frequently one species will arrive from the
north just as another species departs for more southerly latitudes.
From this he reasoned that although it was commonly believed that
such birds were of two different species, there really was only one, and
that this one assumed the different plumages to correspond with the
summer and winter seasons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">-6-</span></p>

<p>Probably the most remarkable theory that has been advanced to
account for migration is contained in a pamphlet mentioned by Clarke
(1912: V. I, 9-11) as published in 1703 under the title: "An Essay
Toward the Probable Solution of this Question: Whence come the
Stork and the Turtle, the Crane, and the Swallow, when they Know
and Observe the Appointed Time of their Coming." It was written
"By a Person of Learning and Piety," whose "probable solution" was
that migratory birds flew to the moon and there spent the winter.</p>

<p>Some peoples, who easily accepted the migratory travels of the
larger birds, were unable to understand how the smaller species, some
of them notoriously poor fliers, could make similar journeys. They
accordingly conceived the idea that the larger species, as the storks and
cranes, carried their smaller companions as living freight. In some of
the Mediterranean countries, it is still believed that these broad-pinioned
birds serve as aerial transports for the hosts of small birds that
congregate upon the shores awaiting opportunity for this kind of passage
to their winter homes in Africa. Similar beliefs have been found
among some tribes of North American Indians.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Advantages_of_Migration"><i>Advantages of Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Before presenting some of the present theories concerning the origin
of bird migration, it seems well to consider briefly the ends that are
served by this annual round trip between breeding grounds and winter
quarters. It is apparent that the migratory habit enables a species to
enjoy the summers of northern latitudes while avoiding the severity
of the winters. In other words, migration makes it possible for some
species to inhabit two different areas during the seasons when each
presents favorable conditions. In the performance of its reproductive
duties, every pair of birds requires a certain amount of territory, the
extent of which varies greatly in different species. Generally, however,
this territory must be large enough to provide adequate food, not
only for the parent birds, but also for the lusty appetites that come
into being with the hatching of the eggs. Thus, if all birds were to
remain constantly either in tropical or in temperate regions, there
would be intolerable overcrowding during the breeding season. By
the spring withdrawal to regions uninhabitable earlier in the year, the
migrants are assured of adequate space and ample food upon their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">-7-</span>
arrival in the winter-freed North, and it may be assumed that the
nonmigratory species that are resident in the South are also benefited
by the departure of the migrants.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the winter or summer area of
every species is entirely unsuited to its requirements at other seasons,
for some individuals pass the winter season in areas that are frequented
only in summer by other individuals of their species. Such species
have extensive breeding ranges, presenting wide climatic variations,
so that some individuals may actually be resident in a region where
others of their kind are present only in winter.</p>

<p>The tendency of some birds to move southward at the approach of
winter is not always due to the seasonal low temperatures, since experiments
have demonstrated that many of our summer insect feeders,
when confined in outdoor aviaries, comfortably withstand temperatures
far below zero. The main consideration is the depletion of the
food supply, caused either by the disappearance or the hibernation of
insects, or by the mantle of snow or ice that prevents access to the seeds
and other forms of food found on or close to the ground or submerged
in water. Possibly also the shortened hours of daylight materially
restrict the ability of the birds to obtain sufficient food at a time when
the cold requires an increased supply to maintain body heat. It is noteworthy
that some of our smaller birds, such as the chickadees, have
no fear of Arctic weather, as their food supplies are entirely arboreal
and so are always available. Also, when there is a good supply of
food in the form of pine and spruce seeds, nuthatches and crossbills
will remain through the winter in Canadian woods. When these
birds appear abundantly in winter at points in southern latitudes, it may
be concluded that there is a shortage of their food in the North.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Origin_of_Migration"><i>The Origin of Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>Migration has long since become a definite hereditary habit that
recurs in annual cycles, probably because of physiological stimulus associated
with the reproductive period. Its origin is locked in the ages
of geologic time, but by study of the history of how birds came to
occupy their present ranges, information becomes available from which
reasonable theories may be developed and explored. The two that are
most commonly accepted are diametrically opposed to each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">-8-</span></p>


<h3 id="Northern_ancestral">Northern ancestral home theory</h3>

<p>According to one of these hypotheses, in earlier ages nonmigratory
birds swarmed over the entire Northern Hemisphere. At that time
the conditions of food and habitat were such as to permit them to
remain in their haunts throughout the year, that is, the entire northern
area then afforded the two important avian requirements&mdash;suitable
breeding conditions, and year-long food supply. This is the condition
today in the Tropics, and it is noteworthy that, as a rule, tropical birds
do not perform migrations. Gradually, however, in the Northern
Hemisphere the glacial ice fields advanced southward, forcing the birds
before them, until finally all bird life was concentrated in southern
latitudes. As the ages passed the ice cap gradually retreated, and each
spring the birds whose ancestral home had been in the North endeavored
to return, only to be driven south again at the approach of
winter. As the size of the ice-covered area diminished the journeys
made became ever longer until eventually the climatic conditions of
the present age became established and with them the habit of
migration.</p>

<p>Thus, this theory supposes that today migratory birds follow the path
of a great racial movement that took place in a distant past and was
associated with the advances and recessions of the ice. The actions of
the birds themselves lend some support to this theory, as every bird student
has noted the feverish impatience with which certain species push
northward in spring, sometimes advancing so rapidly upon the heels
of winter that they perish in great numbers when overtaken by late
storms. It is probable that at this season the reproductive impulse is
a determining factor in driving the birds to their northern breeding
grounds.</p>


<h3 id="Southern_ancestral">Southern ancestral home theory</h3>

<p>The opposing theory is simpler in some respects and supposes that
the ancestral home of all birds was in the Tropics and that, as all
bird life tends to overpopulation, there was a constant effort to seek
breeding grounds where the competition would be less keen. Species
that strove for more northern latitudes were kept in check by the ice
and were forced to return southward with the recurrence of winter
conditions. Gradually, as the ice retreated, vast areas of virgin country
became successively suitable for summer occupancy, but the winter
habitat remained the home to which the birds returned after the nesting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">-9-</span>
season. It is a fact that some species spend very little time on
their breeding grounds; the orchard oriole, for example, spends only
2&frac12; months in its summer home, arriving in southern Pennsylvania
about the first week in May and leaving by the middle of July.</p>

<p>Both of these theories assume that migration is an ingrained habit, but
both have been criticized on biological and geological grounds, so
neither should be accepted without qualification as definitely accounting
for the origin of bird migration. It is apparent, however, that
whether the ancestral home of any species was at the northern or
southern limits of its present range, or even in some intermediate region,
the search for favorable conditions under which to breed in
summer and to feed in winter has been the principal factor underlying
the origin of migration.</p>


<h3 id="photoperiodism">Theory of photoperiodism</h3>

<p>A modern view based on studies of living behavior, suggests also
that there is good reason for believing that migration is an annually
induced movement. If such be true then the theory of photoperiodism
as propounded by some recent investigators should receive some
consideration.</p>

<p>This theory holds as its major premise that quantity of light and
length of day are the stimulating causes of migration. Its proponents
urge that migration is a phenomenon far too regular to be created anew
each season merely under stress of circumstances, such as need for food;
and that it begins before the necessity for a change in latitude becomes
at all pressing. Swallows, nighthawks, shore birds, and others may
start their southward movement while the summer food supply in the
North is at peak abundance; while robins, bluebirds, and others may
leave an abundant food in the South in spring and press toward northern
points when food supplies there are almost entirely lacking and
when severe cold and storms are likely to cause their wholesale destruction.
The regularity of arrival and departure is one of the most
impressive features of migration, and since birds travel in almost strict
accordance with the calendar, the proponents of the theory ask: "What
phenomenon to which we may attribute the stimulating impulse occurs
with such precise regularity as the constantly increasing amount of
light in spring?"</p>

<p>Experimental work has abundantly demonstrated the effect of increased
light upon the growth, flowering, and fruiting of plants.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">-10-</span>
Similarly, experiments with the common junco or snowbird reported
by Rowan (1931: 121), resulted in increased development of the sexual
organs by the end of December, although the birds were confined
in outdoor aviaries in Canada, and had been exposed to temperatures
as low as -44&deg; F. From the first of November until early in January,
the juncos were subjected to ever-increasing light, supplied in the
aviaries by electric bulbs. As regards illumination, they were thus
artificially provided with conditions approximating those of spring.
At the close of this period, it was found that the sexual organs of the
birds had attained the maximum development normally associated
with spring. With gradual reduction of the lighting over a period
of little more than 1 month, the organs returned to their normal winter
condition.</p>

<p>After a consideration of all evidence, including the fact that no ultra-violet
rays were used, it was concluded that the explanation lay in the
increased exercise taken during the periods of increased light. A
simple test whereby certain birds were forced by mechanical means
to take more exercise, the light being so reduced that there was merely
sufficient glow for them to see the advancing mechanism that forced
them into movement, showed that the rate of development of the
sexual organs exactly paralleled that in the birds that were exposed
to extended periods of illumination in the outdoor aviaries. Other
features in this experiment&mdash;such as the behavior of the birds themselves&mdash;also
indicated that more activity due to increased light is the
governing cause of the spring development of the sexual organs. If
this development be accepted as a controlling cause of migration, then
this experiment must be recognized as of great importance.</p>

<p>Upon closer analysis, however, it is found that this theory, like those
before discussed, is open to serious objections. First, some of our
summer residents that migrate south for the winter do not stop in
equatorial regions, where they might find the periods of day and night
about equally divided, but push on beyond, some penetrating as far
south as Patagonia. Also it might be asked: "If the lengthening day
is the stimulating factor, why should our summer birds wintering in
the Tropics ever start northward, as in their winter quarters the variation
in the length of day from winter to summer is imperceptible?"
Like all the other theories advanced, this also, as at present understood,
is subject to unanswered criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">-11-</span></p>


<h3 id="continental_drift">Theory of continental drift</h3>

<p>The theory of continental drift postulates an original northern land
mass, called Laurasia, and a southern one, called Gondwana. According
to this concept, each eventually broke into several segments
which eventually became the present continents. It is further assumed
that occasionally Laurasia and Gondwana drifted close to one another
or were at times in actual contact. On the basis of this geological
theory, Wolfson (1940) has attempted to explain the migrations of
some species of birds from one hemisphere to the other, as, for example,
the Greenland wheatear, Arctic tern, and several shore birds (turnstone,
sanderling, knot, golden plover, and others). Acceptance of this hypothesis
requires abandonment of the belief that the development of
migration was the result of useful ends that were served thereby, and in
its place, to give approval to the idea that migration was merely "the
natural consequence of an inherent behavior pattern responding to the
drifting of continental masses."</p>

<p>It is a strange fact that although almost all professional paleontologists
are agreed that existing data oppose the theory of continental
drift, those who support it contend that their case is strengthened by
these same data. If, in the geologic history of the earth, there was any
such thing as continental drift, it appears from the evidence available
that it was before the Cretaceous period, estimated to have been about
70,000,000 years ago. Birds had then evolved but those known from
fossil remains were of extremely primitive types such as Hesperornis
and Ichthyornis. There is no evidence of the existence in that period
of any birds that were even closely related to any of those now living.
Accordingly, it is difficult to believe that the migratory patterns of
existing species have been determined by events that, if they did take
place, were at least 70,000,000 or more years ago.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="When_Birds_Migrate"><i>When Birds Migrate</i></h2>
</div>


<p>It is known that at any given point many species leave in the fall and
return in the spring. Since banding has had such wide application as
a method of study, it is known also that in some species one of the
parent birds (rarely both) frequently returns and nests in the tree,
bush, or box that held its nest in the previous season. One ordinarily
thinks of the world of birds as quiescent during two periods each year,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">-12-</span>
at nesting time, and in winter. For individuals this is obviously the
case, but when the entire avifauna of the continent is considered it is
found that there are at almost all periods some latitudinal movements.</p>


<h3 id="Movements">Movements of species and groups</h3>

<p>Some species begin their fall migrations early in July and in some
parts of the country distinct southward movements can be detected
from then until the beginning or middle of winter. For example,
many shore birds start south in the early part of July, while the
goshawks, snowy owls, redpolls, Bohemian waxwings, and many
others do not leave the North until forced to do so by the advent of
severe winter weather, or by lack of the customary food. Thus an
observer in the northern part of the United States may record an almost
unbroken southward procession of birds from midsummer to winter,
and note some of the returning migrants as early as the middle of
February. While on their way north, purple martins have been known
to arrive in Florida late in January and, among late arrivals, the northern
movement may continue into the first week of June. In some
species the migration is so prolonged that the first arrivals in the
southern part of the breeding range will have performed their parental
duties while others of that species are still on their way north.</p>

<p>A study of these facts indicates that sometimes there exists a very
definite relationship between what we may term northern and southern
groups of individuals of the same species. A supposition is that for a
species with an extensive latitudinal breeding range, and which has a
normal migration, those individuals that nest farthest south migrate
first and proceed to the southern part of the winter range; those that
occupy the central parts of the breeding range migrate next and travel
to regions in the winter range north of those occupied by the first
group; and finally the individuals breeding farthest north are the last
to start their autumn migration and they remain farthest north during
the winter. In other words, this theory supposes that the southward
movement of the species is such that the different groups maintain their
relative latitudinal position with each other. The black and white
warbler furnishes an example. The breeding range of this bird extends
west and northwest from northern Georgia and South Carolina
to New Brunswick, extending also in a western and northwestern direction
as far as Great Bear Lake in northwestern Canada (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>). It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">-13-</span>
spends the winter in southern Florida, the West Indies, central Mexico,
Central America, and northwestern South America. In the southern
part of its breeding range it is nesting in April, but those that summer
in New Brunswick do not reach their nesting grounds before the
middle of May. Therefore, about 50 days are required for these northbound
birds to cross the breeding range, and if 60 days be allowed for
nest building, egg laying, incubation, care of young, and molt, they
would not be ready to start southward before the middle of July
(<a href="#fig2">fig. 2.</a>). Then another 50-day trip south, and the earliest migrants
from the northern areas would reach the Gulf Coast in September.
But both adults and young have been observed at Key West, Fla., by the
middle of July, and on the northern coast of South America by August
21. Since the birds at Key West were fully 500 miles south of the
breeding range, it is evident that they must have come from the southern
part of the nesting area.</p>

</div>

<p>Many similar cases might be mentioned, such as the black-throated
blue warblers, which are still observed in the mountains of Haiti in
the middle of May, when others of this species are en route through
North Carolina to breeding territory in New England or have even
reached that region. Redstarts and yellow warblers, evidently the more
southern breeders, are seen returning southward on the northern coast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">-15-</span>
of South America just about the time that the earliest of those breeding
in the North reach Florida on their way to winter quarters.</p>


<h3 id="Nocturnal">Nocturnal and diurnal migration</h3>

<p>When one recalls that most birds appear to be more or less helpless
in the dark, it seems remarkable that many should select the night
hours for extended travel. Among those that do, however, are the
great hosts of shore birds, rails, flycatchers, orioles, most of the great
family of sparrows, the warblers, vireos, and thrushes, and in fact, the
majority of small birds. That it is common to find woods and fields
on one day almost barren of bird life, and on the following day filled
with sparrows, warblers, and thrushes, would indicate the arrival of
migrants during the night. Sportsmen sitting in their "blinds"
frequently observe the passage of flocks of ducks and geese, but great
numbers of these birds also pass through at night, the clarion call of
the Canada goose, or the conversational gabbling of a flock of ducks
being common night sounds in spring and fall in many parts of the
country. The sibilant, nocturnal calls of the upland plover or Bartramian
sandpiper and of other shore birds during their spring and fall
flights form vivid memories in the minds of many students of migration.
Observations made with telescopes focused on the full moon
have shown processions of birds, one observer estimating that birds
passed his point of observation at the rate of 9,000 an hour, which gives
some indication of the numbers of birds that are in the air during some
of the nights when migration is at its height. While the steady night-long
passage of migratory birds has been recorded, the bulk of the flocks
pass during the earlier hours of the evening and toward daylight in
the morning, the periods from 8 o'clock to midnight and from 4 to 6
a. m. seeming to be favorite times for nocturnal flight.</p>

<p>It has been claimed, with some reason, that small birds migrate by
night the better to avoid their enemies, and that most of the nocturnal
travelers are those that are naturally timid, sedentary, or feeble-winged.
To a certain extent this may be true as included in this group are not
only such weak fliers as the rails but also the small song and insectivorous
birds such as the wrens, the small woodland flycatchers, and other
species which, living habitually more or less in concealment, are probably
much safer making their flights under the protecting cloak of
darkness. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that night migrants
include also the snipe, sandpipers, and plovers, birds that are always
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">-16-</span>
found in the open, and are among the more powerful fliers, some of
them making flights of more than 2,000 miles across the ocean.</p>

<p>Night travel is probably best for the majority of birds chiefly from
the standpoint of feeding. Digestion is very rapid in birds and yet the
stomach of one killed during the day almost always contains food.
To replace the energy required for long flight, it is essential that food
be obtained at comparatively short intervals, the longest of which
in most species is during the hours of darkness. If the smaller migrants
were to make protracted flights by day they would be likely to
arrive at their destination at nightfall almost exhausted, but since they
are entirely daylight feeders, they would be unable to obtain food until
the following morning. This would delay further flights and result
in great exhaustion or possibly even death were they so unfortunate
as to have their evening arrival coincident with unusually cold or stormy
weather. Traveling at night, they pause at daybreak and devote the
entire period of daylight to alternate feeding and resting. This permits
complete recuperation and resumption of the journey at nightfall.</p>

<p>Many species of wading and swimming birds migrate either by day
or night, as they are able to feed at all hours, and are not accustomed
to seek safety in concealment. Some diving birds, including ducks
that submerge when in danger, sometimes travel over water by day
and over land at night. The day migrants include, in addition to some
of the ducks and geese, the loons, cranes, gulls, pelicans, hawks, swallows,
nighthawks, and the swifts. All of these are strong-winged
birds. The swifts, swallows, and nighthawks (sometimes called bullbats)
feed entirely on flying insects, and use their short, weak feet and
legs only for grasping a perch during periods of rest or sleep. Thus
they feed as they travel, the circling flocks being frequently seen in late
summer working gradually southward. Years ago before birds of
prey were so thoughtlessly slaughtered, great flocks of red-tailed. Swainson's,
and rough-legged hawks might be seen wheeling majestically
across the sky in the Plains States, and in the East the flights of broad-winged.
Cooper's, and sharp-skinned hawks are still occasionally seen.
To the birds of prey and possibly to the gulls also, a day's fasting now
and then is no hardship, particularly since they frequently gorge
themselves to repletion when opportunity is afforded.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 3.</i>&mdash;Migration of the cliff swallow, a day migrant that instead
of flying across the Caribbean Sea as does the blackpolled warbler
(see <a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>), follows around the coast of Central America, where food
is readily obtained. (<a href="#Page_25">See p. 25.</a>)</div>
</div>

<p>An interesting comparison of the flights of day and night migrants
may be made through a consideration of the spring migrations of the
blackpolled warbler and the cliff swallow. Both spend the winter in
South America, at which season they are neighbors. But when the
impulse comes to start northward toward their respective breeding
grounds, the warblers strike straight across the Caribbean Sea to Florida
(<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>), while the swallows begin their journey by a westward flight
of several hundred miles to Panama (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3.</a>). Thence they move
leisurely along the western shore of the Caribbean Sea to Mexico, and
continuing to avoid a long trip over water, they go completely around
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">-18-</span>
the western end of the Gulf of Mexico. This circuitous route adds
more than 2,000 miles to the journey of the swallows that nest in Nova
Scotia. The question may be asked: "Why should the swallow select
a route so much longer and more roundabout than that taken by the
blackpolled warbler?" The simple explanation is that the swallow is
a day migrant while the warbler travels at night. The migration of
the warbler is made up of a series of long, nocturnal flights, alternated
with days of rest and feeding in favorable localities. The swallow, on
the other hand, starts its migration several weeks earlier and catches
each day's ration of flying insects during a few hours of aerial evolutions,
which at the same time carry it slowly in the proper direction.
Flying along the insect-teeming shores of the Gulf of Mexico, the 2,000
extra miles that are added to the migration route are but a fraction
of the distance that these birds cover in pursuit of their daily food.</p>

<p>Although most of our smaller birds make their longest flights at
night, close observation will show that travel is continued to some
extent by day. This is particularly true during the latter half of a migratory
season when the birds show evidence of an overpowering desire
to hasten to their breeding grounds. At this time flocks of birds while
feeding maintain a movement in the general direction of the seasonal
journey. Sometimes they travel hurriedly, and while their flights
may be short, they must cover an appreciable distance in the course
of a day.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="How_Birds_Migrate"><i>How Birds Migrate</i></h2>
</div>


<h3 id="Speed">Speed of flight and speed of migration</h3>

<p>There is a widespread misconception concerning the speed at which
birds normally fly, and even regarding the speed they can attain when
occasion demands, as when closely pursued by an enemy. It is not
unusual to hear accounts of birds flying "a mile a minute." While
undoubtedly some birds can and do attain a speed even greater than
this, such cases are exceptional, and it is safe to say that even when
pressed, few can develop an air speed of 60 miles an hour. They do,
however, have two speeds, one being the normal rate for everyday purposes
and also for migration, and an accelerated speed for escape or
pursuit; this in some cases may be nearly double the normal rate of
movement. Nevertheless, it is doubtful if the effort required for the
high speeds could be long sustained, and certainly not for the long-distance
migratory journeys that are regularly made by most birds.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">-19-</span>
The theory that migrating birds attain high speeds received encouragement
from the German ornithologist G&auml;tke (1895), who for
many years made observations on birds at the island of Heligoland.
He postulated that the blue-throat, a species of thrush smaller than
the American hermit thrush, would leave African winter quarters at
dusk and reach Heligoland at dawn, which would mean a sustained
speed of 200 miles an hour, and that the American golden plover flew
from the coast of Labrador to Brazil in 15 hours, or at the tremendous
speed of 250 miles an hour. Most ornithologists now consider these
conclusions to be unwarranted.</p>

<p>Sportsmen also often greatly overestimate the speed at which ducks
and geese fly and sometimes attempt to substantiate their estimates by
mathematical calculation, based upon the known velocity of a charge
of shot, the estimated distance and the estimated "lead" that was necessary
to hit the bird. If all three elements of the equation were known
with certainty, the speed of the bird could be determined with a fair
degree of accuracy. The majority of the ducks that are reported as
killed at 40, 50, or even 60 yards, however, actually are shot at distances
much less than estimated. To sight along a gun barrel and estimate
correctly the distance of a moving object against the sky is so nearly
impossible for the average gunner as to make such calculations of little
value.</p>

<p>During the past few years reliable data on the speed of birds have
accumulated slowly. It has been found that a common flying speed
of ducks and geese is between 40 and 50 miles an hour, and that it is
much less among the smaller birds. Herons, hawks, horned larks,
ravens, and shrikes, timed with the speedometer of an automobile, have
been found to fly 22 to 28 miles an hour, while some of the flycatchers
are such slow fliers that they attain only 10 to 17 miles an hour. Even
such fast-flying birds as the mourning dove rarely exceed 35 miles an
hour. All these birds can fly faster, but it is to be remembered that at
training camps during World War I, airplanes having a maximum
speed of about 80 miles an hour easily overtook flocks of ducks that,
it may be supposed, were making every effort to escape. Aviators have
claimed that at 65 miles an hour they can overtake the fastest ducks,
though cases are on record of ducks passing airplanes that were making
55 miles an hour.</p>

<p>The greatest bird speeds that have been reliably recorded are of the
swifts and the duck hawk, or peregrine falcon. An observer in an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">-20-</span>
airplane in Mesopotamia reported that swifts easily circled his ship
when it was traveling at 68 miles an hour. To do this, the birds certainly
were flying at a speed as high as 100 miles an hour. Once a
hunting duck hawk, timed with a stop watch, was calculated to have
attained a speed between 165 and 180 miles an hour.</p>

<p>The speed of migration, however, is quite different from that attained
in forced flights for short distances. A sustained flight of 10
hours a day would carry herons, hawks, crows, and smaller birds from
100 to 250 miles, while ducks and geese might travel as much as 400
to 500 miles in the same period. Measured as air-line distances, these
journeys are impressive and indicate that birds could cover the ordinary
migration route from the northern United States or even from northern
Canada to winter quarters in the West Indies or in Central America
or South America in a relatively short time. It is probable that individual
birds do make flights of the length indicated and that barn
swallows seen in May on Beata Island, off the southern coast of the
Dominican Republic, may have reached that point after a nonstop
flight of 350 miles across the Caribbean Sea from the coast of Venezuela.
Nevertheless, whether they continue such journeys day after
day is doubtful.</p>

<p>It seems more likely that migrations are performed in a leisurely
manner, and that after a flight of a few hours the birds pause to feed
and rest for one or several days, particularly if they find themselves in
congenial surroundings. Some indication of this is found in the records
of banded birds, particularly waterfowl. Considering only the
shortest intervals that have elapsed between banding in the North and
recovery in southern regions, it is found that usually a month or more
is taken to cover an air-line distance of a thousand miles. For example,
a black duck banded at Lake Scugog, Ontario, was killed 12 days later
at Vicksburg, Miss. If the bird was taken shortly after its arrival, the
record would indicate an average daily flight of only 83 miles, a distance
that could have been covered in about 2 hours' flying time. Among
the thousands of banding records obtained in recent years, evidences
of such rapid flight are decidedly scarce, for with few exceptions all
thousand-mile flights have required 2 to 4 weeks or more. Among
sportsmen, the blue-winged teal is well known as a fast-flying duck
and quite a few of these banded on Canadian breeding grounds have
covered 2,300 to 3,000 miles in a 30-day period. Nevertheless, the majority
of those that have traveled to South America were not recovered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">-21-</span>
in that region until 2 or 3 months after they were banded. Probably
the fastest flight over a long distance for one of these little ducks was
one made by a young male which traveled 3,800 miles from the delta
of the Athabaska River, in northern Alberta, Canada, to Maracaibo,
Venezuela, in exactly 1 month. This flight was at an average speed
of 125 miles per day. The greatest migration speed thus far recorded
for any banded bird is that of a lesser yellowlegs banded at North
Eastham, Cape Cod, Mass., on August 28, 1935, and killed 6 days later,
1,900 miles away, at Lamentin, Martinique, French West Indies. This
bird traveled an average daily distance of more than 316 miles.</p>

<p>It seems certain that migratory journeys are performed at the normal
rate of flight, as this would best conserve the strength of the birds and
eliminate the fatigue that would result from effort required for great
speed. Migrating birds passing lightships and lighthouses, or crossing
the face of the moon, have been observed to fly without hurry or
evidence of straining to attain high speed.</p>

<p>The speed of migration also is demonstrated by the dates of arrival,
particularly during the spring movement. The Canada goose affords
a typical example of regular, but slow migration. Its advance northward
at this season is at the same rate as the advance of the season
(<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>). In fact, the isotherm of 35&deg; F. appears to be a governing
factor in the speed at which these geese move north, and over their
entire trip the vanguard follows closely the advance of this isotherm.</p>

<p>Few species perform such regular migrations, many waiting in their
winter homes until spring is well advanced and then moving rapidly
to their breeding grounds. Sometimes this advance is so rapid that the
later migrants actually catch up with species that for a month or more
may have been pressing slowly but steadily northward.</p>

<p>One of the best examples of rapid migration is found in the gray-cheeked
thrush. This bird winters in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela,
and British Guiana and does not start its northward journey
until many other species are well on their way. It does not appear in
the United States until the last of April&mdash;April 25 near the mouth of
the Mississippi, and April 30 in northern Florida (<a href="#fig5">fig. 5</a>). A month
later, or by the last week in May, the bird is seen in northwestern
Alaska, the 4,000-mile trip from Louisiana having been made at an
average speed of about 130 miles a day.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 4.</i>&mdash;Migration of the Canada goose. The northward movement
keeps pace with the advance of spring, in this case the advance of
the isotherm of 35&deg; F. agreeing with that of the birds.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">-22-</span></p>

<p>Another example of rapid migration is furnished by the yellow, or
summer, warbler. Coming from the Tropics, the birds reach New
Orleans about April 5, when the average temperature is 65&deg; F. Traveling
north much faster than does the season, they reach their breeding
grounds in Manitoba the latter part of May, when the average temperature
is only 47&deg;. Encountering progressively colder weather over
their entire route, they cross a strip of country in the 15 days from May
11 to 25 that spring temperatures take 35 days to cross. This "catching
up" with spring is habitual in species that winter south of the
United States and in most of the northern species that winter in the
Gulf States. To this rule there appear to be only six exceptions&mdash;the
Canada goose, the mallard, the pintail, the crow, the red-winged blackbird,
and the robin.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 5.</i>&mdash;Isochronal migration lines of the gray-cheeked thrush, an
example of rapid migration. The distance from Louisiana to Alaska
is about 4,000 miles and is covered at an average speed of about
130 miles a day. The last part of the journey is covered at a speed
that is several times what it is in the Mississippi Valley.</div>
</div>

<p>The blue goose presents a striking example of a late but very rapid
spring migration. Practically all members of the species winter in the
great coastal marshes of Louisiana, where 50,000 or more may be seen
grazing in the "pastures" or flying overhead in flocks of various sizes.
Their breeding grounds are chiefly on Baffin Island and on Southampton
Island in the northern part of Hudson Bay, in a region where conditions
of severe cold prevail except for a few weeks each year. The
birds seem to realize that even though the season in their winter quarters
is advancing rapidly, their nesting grounds are still covered with
a heavy blanket of ice and snow. Accordingly they remain in the
coastal marshes until the last of March or the first of April, when the
local birds are already busily engaged with the duties of reproduction.
The flight northward is rapid, almost nonstop, so far as the United
States is concerned, for although the birds are sometimes recorded in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">-24-</span>
large numbers in the Mississippi Valley, including eastern South
Dakota, and in southeastern Manitoba, there are few records anywhere
along the route of such great flocks as are known to winter in Louisiana.
When the birds arrive in the James Bay region of Canada they apparently
enjoy a prolonged period of rest, as they are not noted in the
vicinity of their breeding grounds until the first of June. During the
first 2 weeks of that month they pour into the tundra country by the
thousands, and each pair immediately sets about the business of rearing
a brood.</p>

<p>The robin has been mentioned as a slow migrant, and as a species it
takes 78 days to make the 3,000-mile trip from Iowa to Alaska, a stretch
of country that is crossed by advancing spring in 68 days. In this case,
however, it does not mean that individual robins are necessarily slow,
for probably the northward movement of the species depends upon the
continual advance of birds from the rear, the first individuals arriving
in a suitable locality remaining to nest, while the northward movement
of the species is continued by those still to come.</p>

<p>Special interest attaches to the great variation in the speed at which
birds travel in different sections of the broad flyway extending from
the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean, by way of the Mississippi and
Mackenzie Valleys. The blackpolled warbler furnishes an excellent
example (<a href="#fig6">fig. 6</a>). This species winters in north-central South America
and migrates in April across the West Indies to Florida. From this
point some individuals fly northwest to the Mississippi Valley, north to
Manitoba, northwest to the Mackenzie River, and thence almost due
west to western Alaska. In tracing the long route of these birds it is
found that a fairly uniform average speed of 30 to 35 miles a day is
maintained from the Gulf to Minnesota. Then comes a spurt, for a
week later the blackpolls have reached the central part of the Mackenzie
Valley and by the following week they are observed in northwestern
Alaska. During the latter part of the journey, therefore, many
individuals must average more than 200 miles a day. They use 30
days in traveling from Florida to southern Minnesota, a distance of
about 1,000 miles, and scarcely half that time to cover the remaining
2,500 miles to Alaska. It should be noted that the increased speed is
directly associated with the change in direction, the north-and-south
course in the Mississippi Valley being accomplished slowly while the
northwesterly course across Canada is made at a much greater speed.
Increased speed across western Canada to Alaska is also shown by many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">-25-</span>
other birds. A study of all species traveling up the Mississippi Valley
indicates an average speed of about 23 miles a day. From southern
Minnesota to southern Manitoba 16 species maintain an average speed
of about 40 miles a day. From that point to Lake Athabaska, 12 species
travel at an average speed of 72 miles a day; while 5 others travel to
Great Slave Lake at 116 miles a day; and another 5 species cover 150
miles a day to reach Alaska. This change is in correlation with a
corresponding variation in the isothermal lines, which turn northwestward
west of the Great Lakes.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 6.</i>&mdash;Migration of the blackpolled warbler. The solid isochronal
lines show the places at which these birds arrive at the same time. As
the birds move northward these lines become farther apart, showing
that the warblers move faster with the advance of spring. From
April 30 to May 10 the average speed is about 30 miles a day, while
from May 25 to May 30 it is increased to more than 200 miles.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">-26-</span></p>

<p>As has been previously indicated, the advance of spring in the northern
interior is much more rapid than in the Mississippi Valley and on
the Gulf coast. In other words, in the North spring comes with a
rush and during the height of the migration season in Saskatchewan
the temperature in the southern part of the Mackenzie Valley just about
equals that in the Lake Superior area, which is 700 miles farther south.
Such conditions, coupled with the diagonal course of the birds across
this region of fast-moving spring, exert a great influence on migration
and are the chief factors in the acceleration of speed of travel.</p>

<p>Variations in speed of migration in different parts of the country are
illustrated also by the movements of the cliff swallow (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), which
breeds from Mexico to Alaska and winters in Brazil and Argentina.
It would be expected in spring to appear in the United States first in
Florida and Texas then in the southern Rocky Mountain region, and
finally on the Pacific coast. As a matter of fact, however, the earliest
spring records come from north-central California, where the bird
usually is common before the first arrivals are observed in Texas or
Florida. The route taken, for many years a migration problem, was
solved when it was found that these swallows went around the Gulf of
Mexico rather than across it. The isochronal lines on the map show
the more rapid advance along the Pacific coast. By March 20, when
the vanguard has not quite reached the lower Rio Grande in Texas,
the species is already north of San Francisco in California.</p>


<h3 id="Altitude">Altitude at which birds travel</h3>

<p>At one time students of bird migration held firmly to the theory that
normal migration takes place at heights above 15,000 feet, reasoning
(somewhat uncertainly) that flying becomes easier as altitude is gained.
Since the development of the airplane, however, and with it man's exploration
of the upper regions of the air, it has become common knowledge
that rarified atmosphere adds greatly to the difficulties of flight.
This is due not only to the reduction in oxygen (whether for gasoline
engine or the lungs of a bird) but also to the lack of buoyancy of the
rarified air. Such birds as vultures, pelicans, cranes, and some of the
hawks feel this the least, since compared with body weight the supporting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">-27-</span>
surface of their wings is very great, but for the smaller and
shorter-winged birds lack of buoyancy at high altitudes presents a difficult
obstacle in flight. Even when flying close to the earth, small birds
have to keep their wings in rapid motion.</p>

<p>Another postulate favoring the high-altitude flying theory was that
the wonderful vision of birds was their sole guidance during migratory
flights; and to keep landmarks in view the birds were obliged to fly
high, particularly when crossing wide areas of water. This will be
considered in greater detail under Orientation (p. 28), so here it will
be sufficient to say that birds rely only in part upon vision to guide
them on migration. Also, it is to be remembered that there are definite
physical limitations to the range of visibility even under perfect atmospheric
conditions. Chief of these is the curvature of the earth's surface.
Thus, if birds crossing the Gulf of Mexico to Louisiana and
Florida flew at a height of 5 miles, they would still be unable to see a
third of the way across. And yet this trip is made twice each year by
thousands of thrushes, warblers, and others.</p>

<p>Actual knowledge of the altitude of migratory flight is scanty, though
estimates obtained by means of the telescope, and still more accurate
data resulting from altimeter observation from airplanes, are slowly
accumulating. It is, of course, obvious that some birds that cross
mountain ranges during migration must attain a great altitude. Observers
at an altitude of 14,000 feet in the Himalayas have recorded
storks and cranes flying so high that they could be seen only through
field glasses. Being beyond the range of unaided vision they must
have been at least 6,000 feet above the observers, or at an actual altitude
of 20,000 feet above sea level. Such cases, however, are exceptional
as aviators have reported that they rarely meet birds above an altitude
of 5,000 feet.</p>

<p>It is now known that migration in general is performed below a
height of 3,000 feet above the earth. Some proof of this statement is
available. Observations made from lighthouses and other points of
vantage indicate that migrants commonly travel at altitudes of a very
few feet to a few hundred feet above sea or land. Sandpipers, sanderlings,
and northern phalaropes, observed in migration on the Pacific
oceanic route, have been noted to fly so low that they were visible only
as they topped a wave. Observers stationed at lighthouses and lightships
off the English coast have similarly recorded the passage of land
birds, which sometimes flew just above the surface of the water, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">-28-</span>
rarely above 200 feet. During the World Wars broad areas in the air
were under constant surveillance and among the airplane pilots and
observers many took more than a casual interest in birds. Of the
several hundred records resulting from their observations only 36 were
of birds flying above 5,000 feet, and only 7 above 8,500 feet. Cranes
were once recorded at an altitude of 15,000 feet, while the lapwing
was the bird most frequently seen at high levels, 8,500 feet being its
greatest recorded altitude.</p>

<p>These observations naturally relate only to daytime travelers, but
there is no reason to believe that nocturnal migration is performed at
higher altitudes. The fact that many birds are killed each year by
striking the lanterns at lighthouses, or other man-made obstructions,
does not, however, furnish conclusive proof that low altitudes are generally
used during nocturnal flight, for it should be recalled that these
accidents occur chiefly in foggy or unsettled weather, and also that
powerful lights have a great attraction for many species of birds. The
altitude at which birds travel is affected by other weather conditions
also. For example, flight at the higher elevations is facilitated on
clear, warm days by the currents of warm air that ascend from broad
areas.</p>


<h3 id="Orientation">Orientation</h3>

<p>There probably is no single aspect of the entire subject of bird migration
that challenges our admiration so much as the unerring certainty
with which birds cover thousands of miles of land and water to come
to rest in exactly the same spot where they spent the previous summer
or winter. The records from birds marked with numbered bands
offer abundant proof that the same individuals of many species will
return again and again to their identical nesting sites. These data
show also that many individuals migrate in fall over the same route,
year after year, making the same stops and finally arriving at the
precise thicket that served them in previous winters.</p>

<p>The faculty that enables these birds to point their course accurately
over vast expanses of land and water may, for want of a better term,
be called a "sense of direction." Man recognizes this sense in himself,
though usually it is imperfect and frequently at fault. Nevertheless
the facility with which experienced hunters and woodsmen locate tiny
camps or other points in forested or mountainous country, frequently
cloaked by darkness or fog, with all recognizable landmarks obliterated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">-29-</span>
seems due to this faculty. Ability to travel with precision over unmarked
trails is not limited either to birds or to man. It is likewise
possessed by many other mammals as well as by some insects and fishes,
the well-known migrations of the salmon and the eel being notable
examples.</p>

<p>Ability to follow a more or less definite course to a definite goal is
evidently part of an inherited faculty. Both the path and the goal
must have been determined either when the habit originated or in the
course of its subsequent evolution. The theory is sometimes advanced
that the older and more experienced birds lead the way, showing the
route to their younger companions. This explanation may be acceptable
for some species, but not for those in which adults and the young
migrate at different times. The young cowbird that is reared by
foster parents flocks with others of its kind when grown and in many
cases can hardly be said to have adult guidance in migration. An inherited
migratory instinct with a definite sense of the goal to be reached
and the route to be followed must be attributed to these birds.</p>

<p>It is well known that birds possess wonderful vision. If they also
have retentive memories subsequent trips over the route may well be
steered in part by recognizable landmarks. The arguments against
the theory of vision and memory are chiefly that much migration takes
place by night and that great stretches of the open sea are crossed without
hesitation. Nevertheless, the nights are rarely so dark that all
terrestrial objects are totally obscured, and such features as coastlines
and rivers are just those that are most likely to be seen in the faintest
light, particularly by the acute vision of the bird and from its aerial
points of observation. But some birds fly unerringly through the
densest fog. Members of the Biological Survey, proceeding by steamer
from the island of Unalaska to Bogoslof Island in Bering Sea, through
a fog that was so heavy as to make invisible every object beyond a
hundred yards, recorded the fact that flocks of murres, returning to
Bogoslof, after quests for food, broke through the wall of fog astern,
flew by the vessel, and disappeared into the mists ahead. The ship was
heading direct for the island by the use of compass and chart, but its
course was no more sure than that of the birds.</p>

<p>Some investigators have asserted that the sense of direction has its
seat in the ears or nasal passages and thus that the bird is enabled to
identify air currents and other phenomena. It has been found that
disturbance of the columella or the semicircular canals of the inner ear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">-30-</span>
will destroy the homing instinct of the racing pigeon, but experiments
in the form of delicate operations, or closing the ears with wax, prove
such a serious shock to the sensitive nervous system of the bird that
they cannot be considered as affording conclusive evidence. Several
years ago careful studies were made of the homing instinct of the sooty
and noddy terns, tropical species that in the Atlantic region reach their
most northern breeding point on the Dry Tortugas Islands, off the
southwest coast of Florida. They are not known to wander regularly
any appreciable distance farther north. It was found that some were
able to return to their nests on the Tortugas after they had been taken
on board ship, confined in cages below decks, and carried northward
to distances varying from 400 to 800 miles before being released. Landmarks
of all kinds were entirely lacking, and the birds certainly were
liberated in a region in which they had had no previous experience.</p>

<p>Possibly the "homing instinct" as shown by these terns, by the man-o'-war
birds that are trained and used as message carriers in the Tuamotu,
Gilbert, and Marshall Islands, and by the homing pigeon, is not
identical with the sense of perceptive orientation that figures in the
flights of migratory birds. Nevertheless, it seems closely akin and is
probably caused by the same impulses, whatever they may be and
however they may be received. It should be remembered, however,
that while homing may involve flight from a point that the bird has
never before visited, the flight is always to a known point&mdash;that is,
the bird's nest&mdash;while, on the other hand, the first migratory flight
is always from the region of the bird's birth to a region it has never
before visited. The spring migration might, of course, be more nearly
considered as true "homing."</p>

<p>Some students have leaned strongly toward the possible existence
of a "magnetic sense" as being the important factor in the power of
geographical orientation. The theory that migratory birds might
be responsive to the magnetic field of the earth was conceived as early
as 1855, when some experimental work was done in Russia, and nearly
60 years later in France. Recently investigations in this field have
been conducted by Yeagley (1947) and by Gordon (1948) with diametrically
opposite results. The idea carries with it the implication
that contained in the bird's body is an organ that is sensitive to the
effect of its motion through the vertical component of the magnetic
field and to other related factors. In the tests by Dr. Yeagley, 20 young
homing pigeons were given training flights to their home loft from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">-31-</span>
distances up to 100 miles. Permanent magnets were then affixed to
the under side of the manus part of the wings of half of the birds while
copper plates of equivalent weight were attached to the wings of the
other half. All birds were released singly at an air-line distance of
about 65 miles from the loft. The results were most suggestive, as
only two of the birds carrying magnets returned to the loft, whereas
eight of the controls returned.</p>

<p>With certain minor modifications, this experiment was repeated by
Gordon. In this case 60 pigeons were used and releases were made
from points up to 58 miles, where the direction of flight was such that
the birds had to navigate across the gradient of the magnetic field.
Every bird returned to its loft on the day of release regardless of
whether it carried magnets or unmagnetized bars of the same weight.</p>

<p>Attempts to demonstrate the effect of radio waves on the navigational
ability of birds also have produced contradictory results. In some of
these tests, homing pigeons released near broadcasting stations have
appeared to be hopelessly confused, whereas in others, apparently conducted
in the same manner, no effects could be discerned. It is obvious
that before the electromagnetic theory can be accepted or rejected,
much additional experimental work is necessary.</p>

<p>In concluding this discussion of orientation it is pertinent to point
out that the migratory instinct appears to be more or less transitory,
that it is not persistent over an extended period. Migratory birds may
be arrested en route, either by natural conditions, such as unusual food
supplies, or forcibly by the act of man, and detained until the end or
nearly the end of the migratory season, and then may not attempt
to finish the journey, apparently having lost the migratory impulse.
In the fall and early winter of 1929, abundant food and an open season
caused an unusual number of mallard ducks to arrest their migration
and remain in western Montana and northern Idaho. Later, however,
a heavy snowfall with subzero temperatures suddenly cut off the food
supply, with the result that great numbers of the birds starved to death,
when a flight of a few hours would have carried them to a region of
open water and abundant food.</p>


<h3 id="Segregation">Segregation during migration</h3>

<p>During the height of the northward movement in spring the woods
and thickets may be suddenly filled with several species of wood
warblers, thrushes, sparrows, flycatchers, and others, which it is natural
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">-32-</span>
to conclude have traveled together and arrived simultaneously. Probably
they did, but such combined migration is by no means the rule
for all species.</p>

<p>As a group the wood warblers (<i>Compsothlypidae</i>) probably travel
more in mixed companies than do any other single family of North
American birds. The flocks are likely to be made up of several species
in spring and fall with both adults and young. Sometimes swallows,
sparrows, blackbirds, and some of the shore birds also migrate in mixed
flocks. In fall, great flocks of blackbirds frequently sweep south across
the Plains States, and occasionally one flock will contain bronzed
grackles, red-winged blackbirds, yellow-headed blackbirds, and
Brewer's blackbirds.</p>

<p>On the other hand many species keep strictly to themselves. It
would be difficult for any other kind of bird to keep in company with
one of such rapid movements as the chimney swift, which is rarely
found associated with any other species at any season. Nighthawks
or bullbats also fly in separate companies, as do usually crows, waxwings,
crossbills, bobolinks, and kingbirds. Occasionally, a flock of
ducks will be observed to contain several species, but generally when
they are actually on migration the individuals of each species separate
and travel with others of their own kind. The flocks of blue geese,
previously mentioned in connection with speed of flight (p. 22), frequently
have with them a few of the closely related snow geese, particularly
in the eastern part of their winter range. The portion here
is usually about 10 to 1, but farther west the numbers of snow geese
increase until they outnumber their blue relatives.</p>

<p>The adults of most perching birds drive the young away when they
are grown, probably to be relieved of the necessity of providing for
them, and also in order that the parents may have opportunity to rest
and renew their plumage before starting for winter quarters. The
young birds are therefore likely to drift together and, having no further
responsibility, may start south ahead of their parents. In contrast with
this indifference on the part of the adults of perching birds, Canada
geese and some others remain in family groups, the parent birds undergoing
the wing molt that renders them flightless during the period of
growth of their young, so that old and young acquire their full plumage
at the same time and are able to start south together. The large flocks,
therefore, are composed of many families that band together, and
when they separate into <b>V</b>-shaped units it is probably correct to assume
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">-33-</span>
that it is an old bird that leads the group. Where there is segregation
of the sexes, the young birds usually accompany their mothers, as is
the case with some of the ducks. After the females start to incubate
their eggs, the males of most species of ducks flock by themselves and
remain together until fall.</p>

<p>The males and females of some species may migrate either simultaneously
or separately. In the latter case it is usually the males that
arrive first, sometimes great flocks of male birds, as in the red-winged
blackbird, reaching a locality several days before any of the females.
This is particularly the rule in spring: The first robins are usually found
to be males, as are also the first song sparrows, rose-breasted grosbeaks,
and scarlet tanagers. This early arrival of the males has been explained
on the theory of territorial possession, under which the male
selects the area where it elects to breed, each individual attempting to
protect a definite territory from trespass by other males of his own kind,
at the same time singing or otherwise announcing his presence and
inviting the later arriving female to examine the territory that he has
selected for nesting. The long-billed marsh wren is a noteworthy
example, and the males of this species may enthusiastically build several
dummy nests before the females arrive.</p>

<p>In a few species the males and females apparently arrive at the breeding
grounds together and proceed at once to nest building. In fact
among the shore birds, ducks, and geese, courtship and mating may
take place in whole or in part while the birds are in the South or on
their way north, so that when they arrive at the northern nesting
grounds they are paired and ready to proceed at once with the raising
of their families. Mallards and black ducks may be observed in pairs
as early as January, the female leading and the male following when
they take flight. Naturally these mated pairs migrate north in company,
and it was largely to protect such species that duck shooting in
spring was abolished by Federal law a number of years ago.</p>

<p>Many shore birds nest well within the Arctic Circle, and it is the opinion
of ornithologists that most of these birds share, at least in part, the
habits of the phalaropes, a family in which the male assumes the entire
care of the eggs and young. If this be true, it explains why in southern
latitudes so many of the earliest fall arrivals are females that may have
deserted the breeding grounds after the eggs were laid.</p>

<p>Migratory flights are frequently accomplished in close flock formation,
as with the shore birds, blackbirds, and waxwings, and especially
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">-34-</span>
some of the sparrows&mdash;the snow buntings, longspurs, juncos, and tree
sparrows. Other species, however, though they travel in flocks, maintain
a very loose formation; examples are the turkey vultures, the
hawks, swifts, blue jays, swallows, warblers, and bluebirds. Still
others, the grebes, great horned owls, winter wrens, shrikes, and belted
kingfishers for example, ordinarily travel alone and when several are
found in close proximity it is an indication that they have been drawn
together by unusual conditions, such as abundant food.</p>

</div>


<p>Definite evidence shows that both the length and the duration of
the migratory journey vary greatly. The bobwhite and the western
quails, the cardinal, the Carolina wren, and probably some of the titmice
and woodpeckers, which are apparently almost or quite nonmigratory,
may round out their full period of existence without at any
time going more than lo miles from the nest where they were hatched.</p>


<h3 id="Short">Short and undetermined migrations</h3>

<p>Song sparrows, meadow larks, blue jays, and some other species
make such short migrations that the movement is difficult to detect,
as individuals may be found in one area throughout the year. Thus,
at the southern part of the range there is merely a concentration in
winter, the summer individuals being entirely sedentary. Speculation
is useless on the distances of individual migration without definite evidence
concerning the precise winter quarters of birds that summer in
a particular part of the breeding range of the species, but from the
records of banded birds important evidence is becoming available.
Eventually it may be possible to say definitely just how far the song
sparrows that nest in northern New England and the Maritime Provinces
of Canada travel to their winter quarters, and whether the blue
jays of New York and the upper Mississippi Valley remain throughout
the winter in their breeding areas, or move farther south and relinquish
their places to individuals from southern Canada.</p>

<p>An illustration of what is now known on this subject is found in the
case of the robin. This bird occurs in the Middle Atlantic States
throughout the year, in Canada only in summer, and along the Gulf
coast only as a winter resident. On the Atlantic coast its movements
are readily ascertained, since, for example, in the section about Washington,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">-35-</span>
D. C., the breeding robin is the southern variety (<i>Turdus
migratorius archrusterus</i>) which is found there from the first of April to
the last of October, when its place is taken (in smaller numbers) by the
northern robin (<i>Turdus migratorius migratorius</i>), which arrives about
the middle of October and remains until the following April. It is
probable that a similar interchange of individual robins occurs
throughout a large part of the balance of its range, the hardy birds from
the north being the winter tenants in the abandoned summer homes of
the southern birds.</p>

<p>The red-winged blackbirds that nest in northern Texas are almost
sedentary, but in winter they are joined by representatives of other
subspecies that nest as far north as the Mackenzie Valley.</p>


<h3 id="Variable">Variable migrations within species</h3>

<p>The difference in characters between subspecies has been used by
students of migration to discover other interesting facts concerning
variations of the migratory flight between closely related birds that
breed in different latitudes. The familiar eastern fox sparrow (<i>Passerella
iliaca iliaca</i>) breeds from northwestern Alaska to Labrador, and
in winter is found concentrated in the southeastern part of the United
States. It thus travels a long distance each year. On the west coast
of the continent, however, six subspecies of this bird breed in rather
sharply delimited ranges, extending from the region of Puget Sound
and Vancouver Island to Unimak Island, at the end of the Alaskan
Peninsula. One of these, known as the sooty fox sparrow (<i>P. i. fuliginosa</i>)
breeds in the Puget Sound area and makes practically no migration
at all, while the other races, nesting on the coast of British Columbia
and Alaska, are found in winter chiefly in California. The races
that breed farthest north are in winter found farthest south, illustrating
a tendency for those birds that are forced to migrate to pass over those
so favorably located that they have no need to leave their breeding areas,
while the northern birds settle for the winter in the unoccupied areas
farther south (<a href="#fig7">fig. 7</a>).</p>

<p>Another example of the same kind is the Maryland yellowthroat of
the Atlantic coast. Birds occupying the most southern part of the
general range are almost nonmigratory, residing throughout the year
in Florida, while those breeding as far north as Newfoundland go to
the West Indies for the winter, thus passing directly over the home of
their southern relatives.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">-37-</span></p>

<p>The palm warbler (<i>Dendroica palmarum</i>) which breeds from Nova
Scotia and Maine west and northwest to southern Mackenzie, has been
separated into two subspecies. Those breeding in the interior of
Canada (<i>D. p. palmarum</i>) make a 3,000-mile journey from Great
Slave Lake to Cuba, passing through the Gulf States early in October.
After the bulk have passed, the palm warblers from the Northeastern
States and Provinces (<i>D. p. hypochrysea</i>) drift slowly into the Gulf
Coast region, where they remain for the winter. Their migratory
journey is about half as long as that of the northwestern subspecies.</p>

<p>There is no invariable law governing the distance of migration, although
in general it is found that where a species has an extensive
range, the subspecies that breed farthest north go farthest south to
spend the winter.</p>


<h3 id="Fall_flights">Fall flights not far south of breeding ranges</h3>

<p>Some other species that have extensive summer ranges, for instance
the pine warbler, rock wren, field sparrow, loggerhead shrike, and
black-headed grosbeak, are found to concentrate during the winter
season in the southern part of the breeding range, or to occupy additional
territory that is only a short distance farther south. The entire
species may thus be confined within a restricted area for the period of
winter, and then, with the return of warmer weather, spreads out to
reoccupy the full range.</p>

<p>There are many species, including the tree sparrow, slate-colored
junco, and Lapland longspur, that nest in Canada and winter in the
United States; while others, including the vesper sparrow, chipping
sparrow, grackles, red-winged blackbirds, bluebirds, the woodcock,
and several species of ducks, nest in the northern United States and
move south for the winter to areas along the Gulf of Mexico. This list
includes the more hardy species, some individuals of which may linger
in protected places well within the reach of severe cold, as, for example,
Wilson's snipe or jacksnipe, which frequently is found during subzero
weather in parts of the Rocky Mountain region where warm springs
assure a food supply. More than 100 of our summer birds leave the
United States entirely and spend the winter in the West Indies, or in
Central America or South America. For example, the Cape May
warbler, which breeds from northern New England, northern Michigan,
and northern Minnesota, north to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">-38-</span>
and nearly to Great Slave Lake, is concentrated in winter chiefly in the
West Indies, its metropolis at this season being the island of Hispaniola.</p>


<h3 id="Long_distance">Long-distance migrations</h3>

<p>Some of the common summer residents are not content with a trip
to northern South America, but push on across the Equator and finally
come to rest for the winter in the pampas of Argentina, or even in
Patagonia. Thus some species that are more or less associated with
each other in summer, as nighthawks, barn swallows, cliff swallows,
and some of the thrushes, may also occupy the same general winter
quarters in Brazil. Some individual nighthawks and barn swallows
travel still farther, and of all North American land birds these species
probably have the longest migration route, as they occur north in summer
to Yukon and Alaska, and south in winter to Argentina, 7,000
miles away. Such seasonal flights are exceeded in length, however,
by the journeys of several species of water birds, chiefly members of
the suborder of shore birds. In this group there are 19 species that
breed north of the Arctic Circle and winter in South America, 6 of them
going as far south as Patagonia, and thus having a migration route
more than 8,000 miles in length.</p>

<p>The arctic tern is the champion "globe trotter" and long-distance flier
(<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>). Its name "arctic" is well earned, as its breeding range is circumpolar
and it nests as far north as it can find a suitable place. The
first nest to be found in this region was only 7&frac12; degrees from the
North Pole, and it contained a downy chick surrounded by a wall of
newly fallen snow that had been scooped out by the parent. In North
America the arctic tern breeds south in the interior to Great Slave Lake,
and on the Atlantic coast to Massachusetts. After the young are grown
the arctic terns disappear from their North American breeding
grounds, and a few months later they may be found in the Antarctic
region, 11,000 miles away. Until very recently the route followed by
these hardy fliers was a complete mystery, for although a few scattered
individuals have been noted south as far as Long Island, the species is
otherwise practically unknown along the Atlantic coasts of North
America and South America. It is, however, known as a migrant on
the west coast of Europe and Africa. By means of numbered bands
the picture is now developing of what is apparently not only the longest
but also one of the most remarkable of all migratory journeys.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 8.</i>&mdash;Distribution and migration of the arctic terns of eastern North
America. The route indicated for this bird is unique, as no other
species is known to breed abundantly in North America and to cross
the Atlantic Ocean to and from the Old World. The extreme summer
and winter homes are 11,000 miles apart, and as the route taken is
circuitous, these terns probably fly at least 25,000 miles each year.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">-40-</span></p>

<p>Judging by the evidence at present available it seems likely that the
arctic terns of eastern North America originally found their way here
from the Old World, probably by way of Iceland and Greenland.
Consequently when the time comes for them to migrate to winter
quarters they do not go directly south as do the common and Forster's
terns, but instead they fly back eastward along their ancestral route
across the Atlantic to the shores of Europe and then go south along
the African coast to their winter home. Those that breed in the northwestern
part of the continent, as in Alaska, probably migrate chiefly
down the western coast, as the species is not infrequently reported on
the coast of California and also on the western coast of South America.</p>

<p>The evidence yielded by banding consists of only six definite cases,
but their interpretation permits but one conclusion. All were banded
either as downy chicks or as nonflying immature birds. The details
of their banding and recovery are of sufficient interest to justify citing
in detail. The first was banded on July 3, 1913, at Eastern Egg Rock,
Maine,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and in August 1917 was found dead in the Niger River delta,
West Africa. The second was banded at the Red Islands, Turnevik
Bay, Labrador, on July 22, 1927, and was recovered near La Rochelle,
France, on October 1, 1927. The third, also banded on the Red Islands,
on July 23, 1928, was retaken at Margate, near Port Shepstone, Natal,
South Africa, on November 14, 1928. The fourth, banded at Machias
Seal Island, New Brunswick, on July 20, 1935, was captured near St.
Nazaire, France, October 8, 1935. The fifth and sixth were banded at
Machias Seal Island also; the fifth, banded July 5, 1947, was found on
November 10, 1948, at Kingfisher Creek, Sedgefield, near Wilderness,
Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, while the sixth, banded on July
18, 1948, was picked up dead during the latter part of September 1948
on the hills near Kyle Strome, Sutherland, Scotland. All that remained
of the bird that provides the last-named case was a mutilated
foot and it appeared that it had been the victim of some predator. It
should be pointed out that the flights indicated in the third and fifth
cases detailed above, are the longest known for any birds. Both are
between 8,000 and 9,000 miles, which in the case of No. 3 was accomplished
in less than 3 months.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Recorded at the time of banding as a common tern, a natural

</div>

<p>Probably no other animal in the world enjoys as many hours of
daylight as does the arctic tern, since for these birds the sun never sets
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">-41-</span>
during the nesting season in the northern part of the range, while
during their sojourn in the south, daylight is continuous. During
several months of the year they have 24 hours of daylight and during
the other months considerably more daylight than darkness.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Routes_of_Migration"><i>Routes of Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>While it is beyond question that certain general directions of flight
are constantly followed by migratory birds, it is well to remember that
the term "migration route" is to some extent a theoretical concept concerned
entirely with the lines of general advance or retreat of a species,
rather than the exact course followed by individual birds. Even the
records of banded birds usually show no more than the place of banding
and recovery, and one must have recourse to intermediate records
and to reasoning based on probabilities to fill in details of the route
actually traversed between the two points.</p>

<p>There is also infinite variety in the routes covered during migration
by different species. In fact, the choice of migration highways is so
wide that it seems as if the routes of no two species coincide. Differences
in distance traveled, time of starting, speed of flight, geographical
position, latitudes of breeding and of wintering grounds, and in other
factors, all contribute to this great variation of migration routes.
Nevertheless, there are certain factors that serve to guide the avian
travelers along more or less definite lines, and it is possible to define
general lines of migration for the majority of species.</p>

<p>It has been frequently observed that migrating birds have a tendency
to follow major topographic lines on the earth's surface when
their trend is in the general direction of the birds' journey. Bird
migration is generally thought of as a north-and-south movement,
with the lanes of heavier concentration following the coasts, mountain
ranges, and principal river valleys. To a considerable extent this is
the case, particularly in North America, where the coast lines, mountain
chains, and larger rivers in general run north and south. In cases
where the migration is a long one, however, the notion must be abandoned
that the birds' flight is always restricted to narrow routes that
follow river valleys and the like, as many species seem to disregard
utterly such apparently good natural highways. For example, the
Arkansas River has a general east-and-west course for a great part of
its length, and while it does constitute a route for many perching birds
en route from the Mississippi Valley to the Rocky Mountain region,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">-42-</span>
some of the hawks and many ducks and shore birds pay the valley scant
attention. They may arrest the autumn journey to feed among the
cottonwoods or along sand bars, but when ready to resume their flight
they leave the river and fly directly south over the more or less arid
region that lies between the Arkansas and the Rio Grande.</p>


<h3 id="migration_lanes" class="caption3">Wide and narrow migration lanes</h3>

<p>When birds start their southward migration the movement necessarily
involves the full width of the breeding range. Later there is
a convergence of the lines of flight taken by individual birds, owing
to the conformation of the land mass, and as the species proceeds
southward the width of the occupied region becomes less and less.
An example of this is provided by the common kingbird, which breeds
from Newfoundland to British Columbia, a summer range 2,800 miles
wide. On migration, however, its paths converge until in the southern
part of the United States the occupied area extends from Florida to the
mouth of the Rio Grande, a distance of only 900 miles, and still farther
south the migration path is further restricted. In the latitude of Yucatan
it is not more than 400 miles wide, and it is probable that the great
bulk of the species moves in a belt that is less than half that width.</p>

<p>A migration route, therefore, may be anything from a narrow path
that adheres closely to some definite geographical feature, such as a
river valley or a coast line, to a broad boulevard that leads in the desired
direction and which follows only the general trend of the land
mass. Also it is to be remembered that whatever main routes are
described, there remains a multitude of tributary and separate minor
routes. In fact, with the entire continent of North America crossed
by migratory birds, the different groups or species frequently follow
lines that may repeatedly intersect those taken by others of their own
kind or by other species. The arterial routes, therefore, must be considered
merely as indicating paths of migration on which the tendency
to concentrate is particularly noticeable.</p>

<p>In considering the width of migration lanes it will be obvious that
certain species, as the knot and the purple sandpiper, which are normally
found only along the coasts, must have extremely narrow routes
of travel. They are limited on one side by the broad waters of the
ocean, and on the other by land and fresh water, both of which are
unsuited to furnish the food that is desired and necessary to the well-being
of these species.</p>

</div>

<p>Among land birds that have a definite migration, the Ipswich sparrow
has what is probably the most restricted migration range of any
species. It is known to breed only on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, and it
winters along the Atlantic coast south to Georgia. Living constantly
within sound of the surf, it is rarely more than a quarter of a mile
from the outer beach, and is entirely at home among the sand dunes
and their sparse covering of coarse grass.</p>

however, the lines converge until in southern Central America
they are not more than 100 miles apart. For migration paths of
other widths see figures 9, 11, and 12.</div>
</div>

<p>Harris's sparrow supplies an interesting example of a narrow migration
route in the interior of the country (<a href="#fig9">fig. 9.</a>) This fine, large finch
is known to breed only in the region from Churchill, on the west shore
of Hudson Bay, northwest to the shores of Great Bear Lake. Very
few actual breeding records of the species are available, but these are
sufficient to indicate that the breeding range is in the strip of country
characterized by more or less stunted timber just south of the limit of
trees. When it begins its fall migration, this species necessarily covers
the full width of its breeding area. Then it proceeds almost directly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">-45-</span>
south, or slightly southeasterly, the area covered by the majority of the
birds becoming gradually constricted, so that by the time it reaches the
United States it is most numerous in a belt about 500 miles wide, extending
across North Dakota to central Minnesota. Harris's sparrows
are noted on migration with fair regularity east to the western shore
of Lake Michigan, and west to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains,
but the great bulk of the species moves north and south through a
relatively narrow path in the central part of the continent. Present
knowledge suggests that the reason for this narrow migration range
is the close association that Harris's sparrow maintains with a certain
type of habitat' including brushy places, thickets, edges of groves, and
weed patches. While these environmental conditions are found in
other parts of the country, the region crossed by this sparrow presents
almost a continuous succession of habitat of this type. Its winter
range extends from southeastern Nebraska and northwestern Missouri,
across eastern Kansas and Oklahoma and through a narrow section of
central Texas, at places hardly more than 150 miles wide.</p>

<p>The scarlet tanager presents another extreme case of narrowness of
migration route (<a href="#fig10">fig. 10</a>), its breeding range extending in greatest width
from New Brunswick to Saskatchewan, a distance of about 1,900 miles.
As the birds move southward in fall their path of migration becomes
more and more constricted, until at the time they leave the United
States all are included in the 600-mile belt from eastern Texas to the
Florida peninsula. Continuing to converge through Honduras and
Costa Rica, the boundaries there are not more than 100 miles apart.
The species winters in northwestern South America, where it spreads
out over most of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru.</p>

<p>The rose-breasted grosbeak also leaves the United States through
the 600-mile stretch from eastern Texas to Apalachicola Bay, but
thereafter the lines do not further converge, as this grosbeak enters
the northern part of its winter quarters in Central America and South
America through a door of about the same width (<a href="#fig11">fig. 11</a>).</p>

<p>Although the cases cited represent extremes of convergence, a narrowing
of the migratory path is the rule to a greater or less degree for the
majority of North American birds. The shape of the continent tends
to effect this, and so the width of the migration route in the latitude of
the Gulf of Mexico is usually much less than in the breeding territory.</p>

<p>The redstart represents a notable case of a wide migration route,
although even in the southern United States this is much narrower than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">-46-</span>
the breeding range (<a href="#fig12">fig. 12</a>). These birds, however, cross all parts of
the Gulf of Mexico and pass from Florida to Cuba and Haiti by way of
the Bahamas, so that here their route has a width of about 2,500 miles.</p>

Though the width of the breeding range is about 2,500 miles, the

paths of other widths see figures 9, 10, and 12.</div>

the Bahamas. Their route thus has an east-and-west width of more
than 2,000 miles. For migration paths of greater or less extent see
figures 9, 10, and 11.</div>
</div>

<p>Although this study was confined to this one family of birds there
is a growing mass of evidence in support of the belief that all populations
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">-48-</span>
of migratory birds adhere with more or less fidelity to their respective
flyways. The terms "flyway" and "migration route" have in
the past been used more or less as synonyms but the modern concept
of a flyway is that it is a vast geographic region with extensive breeding
grounds and wintering grounds connected with each other by a more
or less complicated system of migration routes. Each flyway has its
own populations of birds, even of those species that may have a continental
distribution. The breeding grounds of one or more flyways
may (and usually do) overlap broadly, so that during the nesting
season extensive areas may be occupied by birds of the same species but
which belong to different flyways.</p>

<p>The maps (figs. 13, 14, 15, and 16) show the flyways as they are now
understood. It should be pointed out, however, that in the other maps
used in this bulletin, the entire range of a species is shown without
any attempt to distinguish by flyways the different populations. As
banding data accumulate for the nongame species, this distinction will
ultimately be possible, but for the time being, consideration of their
migrations must be chiefly by routes.</p>

<p>The following discussion of the principal routes of North American
birds relates chiefly to the fall migration, for, except as otherwise noted,
the spring flight generally retraces the same course. The routes indicated
on the map (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) must not be considered as representing paths
with clearly defined borders, but rather as convenient subdivisions of
the four great flyways that, as indicated above, cover practically the
entire width of the North American Continent and extend from the
Arctic coast to South America.</p>

<h3 id="Atlantic_oceanic_route">Atlantic oceanic route</h3>

<p>By reference to <a href="#fig17">figure 17</a> it will be noted that route No. 1 is almost
entirely oceanic, passing directly over the Atlantic Ocean from Labrador
and Nova Scotia to the Lesser Antilles, and then through this group
of small islands to the mainland of South America. This is not a
popular route and its chief claim to fame is that it is the fall route
used by most of the adult eastern golden plovers, and probably by some
other shore birds. Since it lies entirely over the sea, this route is definitely
known only at its terminals and from occasional observations
made on Bermuda and other islands in its course. Some of the shore
birds that breed on the Arctic tundra of Mackenzie and Alaska fly
southeastward across Canada to the Atlantic coast and finally follow this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">-50-</span>
oceanic route to the mainland of South America. The golden plover
may accomplish the whole 2,400 miles without pause or rest, in fair
weather the flocks passing Bermuda and sometimes even the islands
of the Antilles without stopping. Although most birds make their
migratory flights either by day or by night, the golden plover in this
remarkable journey flies both day and night. As it swims lightly
and easily it may make a few short stops along the way, and it has
been seen actually resting on the ocean. Other shore birds have been
observed busily feeding in the great area of ocean known as the Sargasso
Sea, where thousands of square miles of floating seaweed teem
with marine life.</p>

<p>The annual flight of the adult eastern golden plover is so wonderful
that it may be given in some detail, particularly since it is one of the
exceptions to the general rule that spring and fall movements are over
the same routes (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). After reaching the South American coast
the birds make a short stop and then continue overland to the pampas
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">-52-</span>
of Argentina, where they remain from September to March. Leaving
their winter quarters, they cross northwestern South America and the
Gulf of Mexico, reaching the North American mainland on the coasts
of Texas and Louisiana. Thence they proceed slowly up the Mississippi
Valley, and by the early part of June are again on their breeding
grounds, having performed a round-trip journey in the form of an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">-53-</span>
enormous ellipse with the minor axis about 2,000 miles and the major
axis 8,000 miles, reaching from the Arctic tundra to the pampas of
Argentina. The older birds are probably accompanied by some of
the young, perhaps those from early nestings, but most of the immature
birds leave their natal grounds late in summer and move southward
through the interior of the country, returning in spring over essentially
the same course. The elliptical route is therefore used chiefly by
fully adult birds.</p>

of about 2,000 miles. The Pacific golden plover, which breeds in
Alaska, apparently makes a nonstop flight across the ocean to
Hawaii, the Marquesas Islands, and the Low Archipelago, returning
in spring over the same route.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">-55-</span></p>


<h3 id="Atlantic_coast_route">Atlantic coast route and tributaries</h3>

<p>The Atlantic coast is a regular avenue of travel, and along it are
many famous points for observing both land and water birds. About
50 different kinds of land birds that breed in New England follow the
coast southward to Florida and travel thence by island and mainland
to South America (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>, route 2). As will be seen from the map,
a seemingly natural and convenient highway extends through the
Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Lesser Antilles to the
South American coast. Resting places are afforded at convenient intervals,
and at no time need the aerial travelers be out of sight of land. It
is not, however, the favored highway, and only about 25 species of
birds go beyond Cuba to Puerto Rico along this route to their winter
quarters, while only 6 species are known to reach South America by
way of the Lesser Antilles. The obvious draw-back is lack of adequate
food. The total area of all the West Indies east of Puerto Rico is less
than that of Rhode Island, so that if only a small part of the birds of
the eastern United States were to travel this way, it is doubtful whether
even the luxuriant flora and fauna of tropical habitats would provide
food sufficient for their needs. Nevertheless, many thousands of
coots, widgeons, pintails, blue-winged teal, and other waterfowl and
shorebirds regularly spend the winter season in the coastal marshes
and the inland lakes and ponds of Cuba, Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>The map (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>) also will show that route No. 3 presents a direct
line of travel for Atlantic coast migrants en route to South America,
although it involves much longer flights. It is used almost entirely
by land birds. After taking off from the coast of Florida there are
only two intermediate land masses where the migrants may pause for
rest and food. Nevertheless, tens of thousands of birds of some 60
species cross the 150 miles from Florida to Cuba where about half this
number elect to remain for the winter months. The others do not
hesitate to fly the 90 miles between Cuba and Jamaica, but from that
point to the South American coast there is a stretch of islandless ocean
fully 500 miles across. Scarcely a third of the North American
migrants leave the forested mountains of Jamaica to risk the perils of
this ocean trip. Chief among these is the bobolink, which so far outnumbers
all other birds using this route that it may be well called the
"bobolink route" (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). As traveling companions along this route,
the bobolink may meet a vireo, a kingbird, and a nighthawk from
Florida; the chuck-wills-widow of the Southeastern States; the black-billed
and the yellow-billed cuckoos from New England; the gray-cheeked
thrush from Quebec; bank swallows from Labrador; and
the blackpolled warbler from Alaska. Sometimes this scattered assemblage
will be joined by a tanager or a wood thrush but the "bobolink
route" is not popular with the greater number of migrants, and
although many individuals traverse it, they are only a small fraction
of the multitudes of North American birds that spend the winter
in South America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">-56-</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig19" style="width: 477px;">

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 19.</i>&mdash;Distribution and migration of the bobolink. In crossing to
South America most of the bobolinks use route 3 (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>), showing
no hesitation in making the flight from Jamaica across an islandless
stretch of ocean. It will be noted that colonies of these birds have
established themselves in western areas, but in migration they adhere
to the ancestral flyways and show no tendency to take the short
cut across Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. (<a href="#Page_55">See p. 55.</a>)</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">-57-</span></p>

<p>Formerly it was thought that most of the North American land
birds that migrate to Central America made a leisurely trip along the
Florida coast, crossed to Cuba, and thence made the short flight from
the western tip of Cuba to Yucatan. A glance at the map would suggest
this as a most natural route, but as a matter of fact it is practically
deserted except for a few swallows and shorebirds, or an occasional
land bird storm-driven from its accustomed course. What actually
happens is that in the fall many of the birds that breed east of the
Allegheny Mountains travel parallel to the seacoast in a more or less
southwesterly direction and, apparently maintaining this same general
course from northwestern Florida, cross the Gulf of Mexico to the
coastal regions of eastern Mexico.</p>

<p>The routes used by the Atlantic brant merit some detail for the reason
that these were long misunderstood. These birds winter on the Atlantic
coast, chiefly at Barnegat Bay, N. J., but (depending upon the
severity of the season and the food available) south also to North Carolina.
Their breeding grounds are in the Canadian arctic archipelago
and on the coasts of Greenland. According to the careful studies of
Lewis (1937), the main body travels northward in spring along the
coast to the Bay of Fundy, hence overland to Northumberland Strait,
which separates Prince Edward Island from the mainland of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia. A minor route appears to lead northward
from Long Island Sound by way of such valleys as those of the Housatonic
and Connecticut Rivers, and on across southern Quebec to the
St. Lawrence River.</p>

<p>After spending the entire month of May feeding and resting in
various parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the eastern segment of the
brant population suddenly resumes its journey by crossing to the north
shore of the St. Lawrence estuary. The Bay of Seven Islands, in this
general region, is the point of departure for long overland flights that
are made by the two segments of the population. The eastern and
larger of these appears to fly almost due north to Ungava Bay and
from there to nesting grounds, probably in Baffin Island and Greenland.
The smaller segment travels a route that is but slightly north
of west to the southeastern shores of James Bay, although somewhere
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">-58-</span>
to the east of that area some of the flocks take a more northwesterly
course, descending the Fort George River to reach the eastern shore
of James Bay about two-thirds of the distance north of its southern
extremity. Upon their arrival at either of these two points on James
Bay, the brant of this western segment turn northward and proceed
through the eastern part of Hudson Bay to their breeding grounds,
probably in western Baffin Island, Southampton Island, and other
islands in the Canadian Arctic.</p>

<p>In general, the fall migration of the brant follows the routes utilized
in the spring. At this season, when gathering for the flight of 570
miles to the St. Lawrence River, they appear only on the western and
southern shores of Ungava Bay. Also, it appears that most of the birds
of the western segment, instead of following the eastern shores of
Hudson and James Bays, turn southwestward across the former, by
way of the Belcher Islands, to Cape Henrietta Maria and from there
south along the western shores of James Bay by way of Akimiski and
Charlton Islands. At the southern end of James Bay they are joined
by those that have taken the more direct route along the east coasts
of the bays and all then fly overland 570 miles to the estuary of the St.
Lawrence River.</p>

<p>The Atlantic flyway receives accretions of waterfowl from three or
four interior migration paths, one of which is of first importance, as
it includes great flocks of canvasbacks, redheads, scaup ducks, Canada
geese, and many of the black ducks that winter in the waters and
marshes of the coastal region south of Delaware Bay. The canvasbacks,
redheads, and scaups come from their breeding grounds on the
great northern plains of central Canada, follow the general southeasterly
trend of the Great Lakes, cross Pennsylvania over the mountains,
and reach the Atlantic coast in the vicinity of Delaware and Chesapeake
Bays. Black ducks, mallards, and blue-winged teals that have gathered
in southern Ontario during the fall leave these feeding grounds
and proceed southwest over a course that is apparently headed for the
Mississippi Valley. Many do continue this route down the Ohio
Valley, but others, upon reaching the vicinity of the St. Clair Flats,
between Michigan and Ontario, swing abruptly to the southeast and,
crossing the mountains in a single flight, reach the Atlantic coast south
of New Jersey. This route, with its Mississippi Valley branch, has
been fully demonstrated by the recovery records of ducks banded at
Lake Scugog, Ontario.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">-59-</span></p>

<p>The white-winged scoter, which also breeds in the interior of the
continent from northern North Dakota north to the Arctic coast, was
at one time credited with an elliptical migration route, at least insofar
as those wintering on the Atlantic coast are concerned. This sea duck
nests only near fresh water but spends the winters on the ocean along
both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. It migrates
over land surfaces mainly at night and it is now believed that after
working northward to the waters of Long Island Sound it starts up
the valleys of the Hudson and Connecticut Rivers and flies overland
to the Great Lakes, from which region it continues west and northwest
to the breeding grounds, returning to its winter quarters over
the same route. Early ideas alleging an elliptical route probably arose
from the fact that great numbers of first-year nonbreeding birds regularly
pass up the New England coast, cross the Gulf of St. Lawrence
and spend the summer loafing off the coast of Labrador. In the fall
these birds form into large flocks and retrace their flight, chiefly during
daylight hours, to winter quarters from southeastern Maine south at
least to Chesapeake Bay. As it was not known that the white-winged
scoter does not usually breed until it is 2 years old, and since the southward
movement of yearling birds was conspicuous while the travels of
those from the nesting grounds were chiefly at night, the theory was
advanced that the latter flew 1,500 miles due east from the region west
of Hudson Bay to the coast of Labrador, thence southward to the known
winter quarters.</p>

<p>A study of the Canada geese that winter abundantly in the waters
of Back Bay, Va., and Currituck Sound, N. C., reveals another important
tributary to the Atlantic coast route. Banding has shown
that the principal breeding grounds of these birds are among the islands
and on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay. From this region they move
south in autumn to the point of Lower Ontario between Lakes Erie
and Huron. Occasionally one of these geese will be recovered in the
Mississippi Valley but the great majority are retaken either on their
breeding grounds or on the Atlantic coast south of Delaware Bay,
showing another instance of a long cross-country flight by waterfowl.
Although the Canada goose is abundant in migration on the coast of
New England, the birds taken there rarely include any of those banded
in southern Ontario. The northeastern population of these geese
comes from breeding areas in New England, the Maritime Provinces
of Canada, Newfoundland, and the desolate coast of Labrador, their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">-60-</span>
migration being entirely coastwise. Still another cross-country route
between the Mississippi Valley and the Atlantic coast remains to be
briefly described. It is not yet well understood, but the banding of
ducks such as the blue-winged teal on the coastal saw-grass marshes of
South Carolina has revealed that there is a migration route across the
Appalachians to the Mississippi Valley. Birds marked in these
marshes have been retaken in Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as in
other States farther north in the Mississippi Flyway.</p>


<h3 id="Mackenzie_Valley">Mackenzie Valley&mdash;Great Lakes&mdash;Mississippi Valley route
and tributaries</h3>

<p>Easily the longest route of any in the Western Hemisphere is that
extending from the Mackenzie Valley past the Great Lakes and down
the Mississippi River, including its tributaries. Its northern terminus
is on the Arctic coast in the regions of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, and
the mouth of the Mackenzie River, while its southern end lies in Patagonia.
During the spring migration some of the shore birds traverse
the full extent of this great path, and it seems likely that the nighthawk,
the barn swallow, the blackpolled warbler, and individuals of
several other species that breed north to Yukon and Alaska must twice
each year cover the larger part of it.</p>

<p>For more than 3,000 miles&mdash;from the mouth of the Mackenzie to the
delta of the Mississippi&mdash;this route is uninterrupted by mountains.
In fact, there is not even a ridge of hills high enough to interfere with
the movements of the feathered travelers, and the greatest elevation
above sea level is less than 2,000 feet. Well timbered and watered, the
entire region affords ideal conditions for the support of its great hosts
of migrating birds. It is followed by such vast numbers of ducks, geese,
shore birds, blackbirds, sparrows, warblers, and thrushes, that observers
stationed at favorable points in the Mississippi Valley daring the height
of migration can see a greater number of species and individuals than
can be noted anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Starting in the region of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska, the route extends
eastward across northern Alaska and joins another that has its origin
at the mouth of the Mackenzie River. The line of flight then trends
a little east of south through the great lake system of central Canada,
where it is joined by two or three other routes from the northeast that
have their origin on the central Arctic coast. Continuing southward
the migrating flocks are constantly augmented by additions to their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">-61-</span>
numbers as they pass over the great breeding grounds of central and
southern Canada. Upon reaching the headwaters of the Missouri and
Mississippi Rivers the route follows these streams to the Gulf coast,
Arriving in this latitude many species, including the ducks and geese,
the robin, the myrtle warbler, and some others spread out east and west
for their winter sojourn. Others, despite the perils of a trip involving
a flight of several hundred miles across the Gulf of Mexico, strike out
boldly for Central America and South America. This part of the route
is a broad "boulevard" extending from northwestern Florida to eastern
Texas and reaching southward across the Gulf of Mexico to Yucatan
and the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>, route 4). In other words,
when most of the birds (chiefly shore birds and land birds) that have
come south directly through the Mississippi Valley have reached the
coastal plains of Mississippi and Louisiana, they continue directly
across the Gulf of Mexico. This route appears to have preference over
the safer but more circuitous land or island routes by way of Texas
and Florida. During the height of migration some of the islands off
the coast of Louisiana are wonderful observation points for the student
of birds, as the feathered travelers literally swarm over them.</p>

<p>Present detailed knowledge of the chief tributaries to the Mackenzie&mdash;Great
Lakes&mdash;Mississippi Valley highway relates chiefly to waterfowl.
Reference already has been made to the flight of the black ducks
(p. 58) that reach the Mississippi Valley from southern Ontario. Some
individuals of this species banded at Lake Scugog, Ontario, have been
recaptured in succeeding seasons in Wisconsin and Manitoba, but the
majority have been retaken at points south of the junction of the Ohio
River with the Mississippi, definitely indicating their route of travel
from southern Ontario.</p>

<p>A second route that joins the main artery on its eastern side is the one
used by the blue goose, the migration route of which is probably more
nearly due north and south than that of any other North American
bird. The breeding grounds, which only in recent years have been
discovered, are mainly in the Fox Basin region of Baffin Island and
on Southampton Island. In fall these geese work southward, chiefly
along the eastern shore of Hudson Bay, and upon reaching the southern
extremity of James Bay they take off for what is practically a nonstop
flight to the great coastal marshes of Louisiana west of the delta of
the Mississippi River. In some seasons the flocks make intermediate
stops among the islands and sand bars of the Mississippi, as they are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">-62-</span>
occasionally common in the general vicinity of Memphis, Tenn. Most
of the birds push on, however, and during the period from the first
of November to the last of March fully 90 percent of the species are
concentrated in the area between the Sabine and the Mississippi Rivers.
On the return trip northward there is sometimes a tendency for some of
the blue geese to veer off toward the northwest, as they are occasionally
abundant in eastern South Dakota and southeastern Manitoba. It is of
particular interest to note that while some other geese and many ducks
start their northward journey at the first sign of awakening spring,
the blue goose remains in its winter quarters until the season there is
far advanced, seemingly aware that its own breeding grounds in the
Arctic are still in the grip of winter.</p>


<h3 id="Great_Plains">Great Plains&mdash;Rocky Mountain routes</h3>

<p>A great western highway also has its origin in the Mackenzie River
delta area and in Alaska. This is used chiefly by the pintail and the
American widgeon or baldpate, which fly southward through eastern
Alberta to western Montana. Some localities in this area, as for example,
the National Bison Range at Moiese, Mont., normally furnish
food in such abundance as to induce these birds to pause in their migratory
movement. Upon resuming travel, some flocks move almost
directly west across Idaho to the valley of the Columbia River, from
which they turn abruptly south to the interior valleys of California.
Others leave the Montana feeding and resting areas and turn southeastward
across Wyoming and Colorado to join the flocks that are moving
southward through the Great Plains (<a href="#fig15">fig. 15</a>).</p>

<p>Many redheads that breed in the Bear River marshes in Utah take a
westerly route across Nevada to California, but some leave these breeding
grounds and fly northeastward across North Dakota and Minnesota
to join the flocks of these ducks that come out of the prairie regions
of Canada. A few of them even travel southeastward to the Atlantic
coast. This route can be traced by the records of ducks banded in summer
in the Bear River marshes and retaken the following fall at points
in eastern Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Maryland. Great numbers,
however, follow another route from these marshes across the mountains
in an easterly direction, where it almost immediately turns southward
through Colorado and New Mexico, and continues to winter quarters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">-63-</span>
in the Laguna Madre off the coast of Texas or in the Valley of Mexico
(<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>, route 6). This route also represents the travels of many of the
land birds of the Rocky Mountain region. Such birds perform comparatively
short migrations, most of them being content to stop when
they reach the middle districts of Mexico, only a few passing beyond
the southern part of that country.</p>

<p>Observations made in the vicinity of Corpus Christi, Tex., have
shown one of the short cuts (<a href="#fig17">fig. 17</a>, route 5) that is, in effect, a part of
the great artery of migration. Thousands of birds pass along the
coast to the northern part of the State of Vera Cruz. As the coast of
the State of Tamaulipas to the north is arid and so entirely unsuited to
the needs of birds that are frequenters of moist woodlands, it is probable
that much or all of this part of the route is a short distance off shore. It
is used by such woodland species as the golden-winged warbler, the
worm-eating warbler, and the Kentucky warbler.</p>


<h3 id="Pacific_coast">Pacific coast route</h3>

<p>Although it does present features of unusual interest, the Pacific
coast route is not of so great importance as some of the others described.
Because of the equable conditions that prevail, many species of birds
along the coast from the Northwestern States to southeastern Alaska
either do not migrate at all or else make relatively short journeys. This
route has its origin chiefly in Alaska, the general region of the delta
of the Yukon River marking its northern terminus, although a few
species join it after a flight westward along the Alaskan Arctic coast.
Some of the scoters and other sea ducks of the north Pacific region,
and the diminutive cackling goose which breeds in the delta of the
Yukon River, use the coastal sea route for all or most of their southward
flight. The journey of the cackling goose, as shown by return records
from birds banded at Hooper Bay, Alaska, has been traced southward
across the Alaska Peninsula and apparently across the Gulf of Alaska
to the Queen Charlotte Islands, the birds following the coast line south
to near the mouth of the Columbia River. There the route swings
toward the interior for a short distance before continuing south by
way of the Willamette River Valley. The winter quarters of the
cackling goose are chiefly in the vicinity of Tule Lake, on the Oregon-California
line, and in the Sacramento Valley of California, though a
few push on to the San Joaquin Valley.</p>

to Great Slave and Athabaska Lakes, where it joins thousands of other
waterfowl bound for their winter homes along the eastern coast of the
United States and the Gulf of Mexico. But when the Ross's geese
have traveled south approximately to the northern boundary of Montana,
they separate from their companions, and turning to the southwest
cross the Rocky Mountains and settle for the winter in California.</p>

<p>The route taken by the white-winged scoters that winter on the
Atlantic coast already has been indicated (p. 59). Some birds of this
species, however, winter on the Pacific coast from Puget Sound south
to southern California. Their passage by thousands up and down the
coast has been noted as far north as northwestern British Columbia.
The species is known to nest in Alaska, which may be the home of
some, at least, of the scoters that winter on the Pacific coast. If such
be the case, however, it must be admitted that a part of the route taken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">-66-</span>
by the birds when on migration is unknown, though very few observations
are available from the interior of northern British Columbia,
across which the route may lie.</p>

<p>The southward route of those migratory land birds of the Pacific
coast that in winter leave the United States extends chiefly through the
interior of California to the mouth of the Colorado River and on to
winter quarters in western Mexico.</p>

<p>The movements of the western tanager show a migration route
that is in some ways remarkable. The species breeds in the mountains
from the northern part of Baja California and western Texas north
to northeastern British Columbia and southwestern Mackenzie. Its
winter range is in two discontinuous areas&mdash;southern Baja California
and eastern Mexico south to Guatemala (<a href="#fig21">fig. 21</a>). On the spring
migration the birds enter the United States about April 20, appearing
first in western Texas and the southern parts of New Mexico and
Arizona (<a href="#fig22">fig. 22</a>). By April 30 the vanguard has advanced evenly to
an approximate east-and-west line across central New Mexico, Arizona,
and southern California. But by May 10 the easternmost birds have
advanced only to southern Colorado, while those in the far west have
reached northern Washington. Ten days later the northward advance
of the species is shown as a great curve, extending northeastward
from Vancouver Island to central Albert and thence southeastward
to northern Colorado. Since these tanagers do not reach northern
Colorado until May 20, it is evident that those present in Alberta on
that date, instead of traveling northward through the Rocky Mountains,
which from the location of their summer and winter homes
would seem to be the natural route, reached there by the Pacific coast
route to southern British Columbia and thence across the mountains,
despite the fact that these are still partly covered with snow at that time.</p>


<h3 id="Pacific_oceanic_route">Pacific oceanic route</h3>

<p>The route of the Pacific golden plover is fully as interesting and
as remarkable as the elliptical course followed by its eastern cousin
(<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). The breeding range of the eastern golden plover extends
through Arctic America west to the northern coast of Alaska where,
in the vicinity of Point Barrow, it meets the nesting grounds of the
Pacific form, which is really an Asiatic subspecies. It breeds chiefly
in the Arctic coast region of Siberia and merely overflows onto the
Alaskan coast, some of the birds probably migrating south along the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">-67-</span>
coast of Asia to winter quarters in Japan, China, India, Australia, New
Zealand, and Oceania, including the Hawaiian Islands, the Marquesas
Islands, and the Low Archipelago. Golden plovers in migration
have been observed at sea on a line that apparently extends from these
islands to the Aleutians, and it therefore appears certain that at least
some of the Alaskan birds make a nonstop flight across a landless sea
from Alaska to Hawaii. While it would seem incredible that any birds
could lay a course so straight as to attain these small oceanic islands,
2,000 miles south of the Aleutians, 2,000 miles west of Baja California,
and nearly 4,000 miles east of Japan, the evidence admits only the
conclusion that year after year this transoceanic round-trip journey
between Alaska and Hawaii is made by considerable numbers of
golden plovers.</p>

  <div class="caption"><i>Figure 22.</i>&mdash;Migration of the western tanager. The birds that arrive

indicate that they migrate north through California, Oregon, and
Washington, and then cross the mountains of British Columbia.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">-68-</span></p>

<p>The Pacific oceanic route probably is used also by the arctic terns
that breed in Alaska, and possibly by those from the more western
tern colonies of Canada. This species is of regular occurrence on
the western coasts of both the United States and South America,
indicating that the western representatives travel southward to the
Antarctic winter quarters without the spectacular migration features
that appear to characterize the flight of those from the eastern part
of the continent (<a href="#fig8">fig. 8</a>).</p>


<h3 id="Arctic_routes">Arctic routes</h3>

<p>In the discussion of the migration of the Arctic tern (p. 38) it was
noted that this species makes a very distinct west-to-east movement
across northern Canada, continuing the flight eastward across the
Atlantic Ocean toward the western coast of Europe. It seems likely
that there are other species, including the parasitic jaeger, that regularly
breed in the northern part of the Western Hemisphere but migrate
back to the Old World for their winter sojourn. Some others, as
the red-legged kittiwake and Ross's gull, remain near the Arctic region
throughout the year, retreating southward in winter only a few
hundred miles. The emperor goose in winter is found only a relatively
short distance south of its breeding grounds, and eider ducks, although
wintering in latitudes well south of their nesting areas, nevertheless
remain farther north than do the majority of other species of ducks.</p>

<p>The routes followed by these birds are chiefly coastwise, and in the
final analysis may be considered as being tributary either to the Atlantic
or to the Pacific coast routes. The passage of gulls, ducks, the black
brant, and other water birds at Point Barrow, Alaska, and at other
points on the Arctic coast, has been noted by several observers, and
from present knowledge it may be said that the best defined Arctic
route in North America is the one that follows around the coast of
Alaska.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Evolution_of_Migration_Routes"><i>Evolution of Migration Routes</i></h2>
</div>


<p>From the foregoing descriptions of migration routes it will be
observed that the general trend of migration in most species of North
American birds is northwest and southeast. It is comparatively easy
to trace the probable steps in the evolution of the migrations of some
species, and some routes have developed so recently that they still
plainly show their origin.</p>

<p>The tendency is for eastern species to extend their ranges by pushing
westward, particularly in the north. For example, in the Stikine
River Valley of northern British Columbia and southwestern Alaska
the eastern nighthawk, eastern chipping sparrow, rusty blackbird,
eastern yellow warbler, redstart, and others have established breeding
stations at points 20 to 100 miles from the Pacific Ocean. The
robin, flicker, slate-colored junco, blackpolled and myrtle warblers,
and ovenbird, all common eastern species, also are established as breeding
birds in western Alaska, the ovenbird having been detected on the
lower Yukon River. These birds are essentially Atlantic and Mississippi
Flyway species, however, and so do not migrate in fall by any of
the Pacific or Central routes, but instead retrace their journey across
the mountains and move southward along the broad flyways of the East.</p>

<p>The red-eyed vireo, a striking example of an abundant woodland
bird, is essentially an inhabitant of States east of the Great Plains, but
an arm of its breeding range extends northwest to the Pacific coast in
British Columbia (<a href="#fig23">fig. 23</a>). It seems evident that this is a range extension
that has taken place comparatively recently by a westward movement
from the upper Missouri Valley, and that the invaders retrace in
spring and fall the general route by which they originally entered the
country.</p>

<p>In the case of the bobolink, a new extension of the breeding range,
and a consequent change in the migration of the species, has taken
place since the settlement of the country (<a href="#fig19">fig. 19</a>). A bird of damp
meadows, it was originally cut off from the Western States by the
intervening arid regions. But with the advent of irrigation and the
bringing of large areas under cultivation, small colonies of nesting
bobolinks have appeared at various western points, and now the species
is established as a regular breeder in the great mountain parks and
irrigated valleys of Colorado and elsewhere almost to the Pacific coast.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">-71-</span>
In retracing their course to reach the western edge of the route followed
by the bulk of the bobolinks that breed in the northern United States
and southern Canada, these western pioneers must fly long distances
along a line that runs almost due east and west.</p>

<p>Similarly it is possible to sketch what seems to be the logical evolution
of the remarkable routes of the golden plover (<a href="#fig18">fig. 18</a>). It may be
assumed that the eastern birds of this species first followed an all-land
route from the South American winter quarters through Central
America, Mexico, and Texas to the western parts of the Mississippi
Valley. As the migration route lengthened northward with the retreat
of the ice and the bird's powers of flight developed, there would
be a tendency to straighten the line and to shorten it by cutting off
some of the great curve through Mexico and Texas. First a short
flight across the western part of the Gulf of Mexico was probably
essayed. Proving successful, this was followed by flight lines that
moved farther east, until finally the roundabout curve through Texas
was entirely discarded and the flight made directly across the Gulf
to southern Louisiana.</p>

<p>As the great areas in Canada were gradually added to the birds'
domain, other important factors arose, the chief being the attractiveness
of the vast stretches of coast and plain of the Labrador Peninsula,
which in fall offered a bountiful store of berries. The fall route therefore
worked eastward to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, thence southwest
along the coast to Florida and across the Gulf of Mexico to the Central
American mainland. A series of shortening flights followed to take
out the great curve of the Atlantic coast. A relatively short ocean
flight was probably attempted, say from Cape Cod to the Bahama
Islands, Cuba, and Jamaica, followed eventually by the long direct
oceanic route as it is now known.</p>

<p>As the Labrador Peninsula in spring is bound by frost and shrouded
in fog while the season advances rapidly through the interior, the
oceanic route proved useful only in fall, and the spring flight continued
through the Mississippi Valley. This outline, although entirely hypothetical,
gives a probable and fairly plausible explanation of the origin
of this wonderful route, particularly when it is remembered that migration
routes as now known are evolutions&mdash;age-long modifications
of other routes.</p>

<p>The evolution of the migration route of the Pacific golden plover
may be explained in a similar fashion. At first the route probably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">-72-</span>
followed the Asiatic coast, through the Malay Peninsula and Oceania,
thence east in a great curve to the Low Archipelago, with individuals
and flocks dropping out to winter at many points along the way. The
Siberian birds probably continue to follow this ancient highway, but
those nesting in Alaska began a long evolutionary series of flights that
cut down the length of their journey by shortening the curve, until
finally the transoceanic route of the present day was developed.</p>

<p>This theory of the evolution of migration routes has been questioned
by some ornithologists on the ground that it implies the possession in
some degree of reasoning powers such as would be used by human
beings. This opposition suggests that changes in migration routes
might develop suddenly following mass survival of birds that were
driven over the new route by a storm on some specific occasion. In
the language of genetics, the new route would be, in effect, a mutation,
rather than the result of an accumulation of infinitesimal variations.
There is some evidence in support of this opposing theory. For example,
information from the Hudson's Bay Co. post at Great Whale
River, on the southeastern coast of Hudson Bay, indicates that in 1884
the snow geese suddenly changed their route from the eastern to the
western coasts of Hudson and James Bays. According to one report,
this change was caused by strong winds from the south which caught
the birds in their fall migration and caused them to cross the entrance
of James Bay from Cape Jones to the western side; the route thus reportedly
forced upon them was then used in succeeding years.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Vertical_Migration"><i>Vertical Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>In the effort to find winter quarters furnishing satisfactory living
conditions, many North American birds fly hundreds of miles across
land and sea. Others, however, are able to attain their objective merely
by moving down the sides of a mountain. In such cases a few hundred
feet of altitude correspond to hundreds of miles of latitude. Movements
of this kind, known as "vertical migrations," are found wherever
there are large mountain ranges. In the Rocky Mountain region they
are particularly notable, as chickadees, rosy finches, juncos, pine grosbeaks,
and some other species that nest in the Alpine Zone move down
to the lower levels to spend the winter. It has been noted that such
species as Williamson's sapsucker and the western wood pewee, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">-73-</span>
nest in the higher mountains, move down to the lower regions in
August following the breeding season. There is a distinct tendency
among the young of mountain-breeding birds to work down to the
lower levels as soon as the nesting season is over. The sudden increases
among birds in the edges of the foothills are particularly noticeable
when cold spells with snow or frost occur at the higher altitudes.</p>

<p>Some species that normally breed in the Hudsonian or Arctic Zones
find suitable breeding areas on the higher levels of the mountains, as for
example the pipit, or titlark, which breeds on the tundra of Alaska and
northern Canada and also south as far as Colorado on the summits of
many peaks in the Rocky Mountains. On the other hand, a few
species, as the Clark's crow, or nutcracker, nest at relatively low altitudes
in the mountains and as the summer advances move higher up,
thus performing a vertical migration that in a sense is comparable with
the post-breeding movements of herons on the Atlantic coast. These
illustrations show that the length of a migration route may depend
upon factors other than latitude.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Vagrant_Migration"><i>Vagrant Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The most striking feature of the migrations of some of the herons
is a northward movement after the nesting season. The young of
some species commonly wander late in the summer and in fall, sometimes
traveling several hundred miles north of the district in which
they were hatched. The little blue heron breeds commonly north
to South Carolina, and by the last of July the young birds begin to
appear along the Potomac, Patuxent, and Susquehanna Rivers, tributary
to Chesapeake Bay. Although almost all are immature individuals,
as shown by their white plumage, an occasional adult may be
noted. With them come egrets and snowy herons and on occasion
all three species will travel in the East as far north as New England,
and in the Mississippi Valley to southeastern Kansas and Illinois. In
September most of them disappear, probably returning south by the
same route.</p>

<p>The black-crowned night heron has similar wandering habits, and
young birds banded in a large colony at Barnstable, Mass., have been
recaptured the same season north to Maine and Quebec and west to
New York. This habit seems to be shared by some of the gulls also,
although here the evidence is not so conclusive. Herring gulls banded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">-74-</span>
as chicks at colonies in the Great Lakes have scattered in all directions
after the breeding season, some having been recovered well north in
Canada.</p>

<p>These movements may be considered as migration governed only by
the availability of food, and they are counteracted in fall by a directive
migratory impulse that carries back to their normal winter homes in
the south those birds that after the nesting period attained more
northern latitudes. They are not to be compared with the great invasions
of certain birds from the North. Classic examples of the latter
in the eastern part of the country are the periodic flights of crossbills.
Sometimes these migrations will extend well south into the Carolinian
Zone.</p>

<p>Snowy owls are noted for occasional invasions that have been correlated
with the periodic maximum of Arctic foxes and the lemming
cycle in the north. According to Gross (1947) 24 major invasions
occurred between 1833 and 1945. The interval between these varied
from 2 to 14 years, but nearly half (11) were at intervals of 4 years.
A great flight occurred in the winter of 1926-27 when more than 1,000
records were received from New England alone, but the largest on
record was in 1945-46 when the "Snowy Owl Committee" of the American
Ornithologists' Union received reports of 13,502 birds, of which
4,443 were reported as killed. It extended over the entire width of the
continent from Washington and British Columbia to the Atlantic coast
and south to Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Maryland.
One was taken as far south as South Carolina.</p>

<p>In the Rocky Mountain region great flights of the beautiful Bohemian
waxwing are occasionally recorded. The greatest invasion in the history
of Colorado ornithology occurred in February 1917, at which time
the writer estimated that at least 10,000 were within the corporate
limits of the city of Denver. The last previous occurrence of the species
in large numbers in that section was in 1908.</p>

<p>Evening grosbeaks likewise are given to performing more or less
wandering journeys, and curiously enough, in addition to occasional
trips south of their regular range, they travel east and west, sometimes
covering long distances. For example, grosbeaks banded at Sault
Ste. Marie, Mich., have been recaptured on Cape Cod, Mass., and in the
following season have been retrapped at the banding station. Banding
records demonstrate that this east-and-west trip across the northeastern
part of the country is sometimes made also by purple finches.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Perils_of_Migration"><i>Perils of Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The period of migration is a season full of peril for birds. Untold
thousands of the smaller migrants are destroyed each year by storms
and through attacks of predatory birds, mammals, and reptiles. If
each pair of adult birds should succeed in raising two fledglings to
maturity, the population of migratory birds would have a potential
annual increase of 100 percent and the world would soon be heavily
overpopulated with them. Since there is no such increase it is evident
that the annual mortality from natural causes is heavy enough to keep
it in check.</p>


<h3 id="Storms">Storms</h3>

<p>Of the various factors limiting the abundance of birds, particularly
the smaller species, storms are the most potent. Special sufferers are
those birds that in crossing broad stretches of water are forced down
by a storm within reach of the waves. Such a catastrophe was once
seen from the deck of a vessel in the Gulf of Mexico, 30 miles off the
mouth of the Mississippi River. Great numbers of migrating birds,
chiefly warblers, had accomplished nearly 95 percent of their long
flight and were nearing land, when, caught by a norther against which
they were unable to contend, hundreds were forced into the waters of
the Gulf and drowned. On another occasion, on Lake Michigan, a
severe storm came up at a time when large numbers of migratory
birds were crossing and forced numerous victims into the waves. During
the fall migration of 1906, when thousands of birds were crossing
Lake Huron, a sudden drop in temperature accompanied by a heavy
snowfall resulted in the death of incredible numbers. Literally thousands
were forced into the water and subsequently cast up along the
beaches, where in places their bodies were piled in windrows. On one
section of the beach the dead birds were estimated at 1,000 per mile,
and at another point at 5 times that number. Most of them were species
that rank among our most desirable birds as destroyers of insects and
weed seeds, including slate-colored juncos, tree sparrows, white-throated
sparrows, swamp sparrows, winter wrens, and golden-crowned
kinglets, together with many brown creepers, hermit thrushes,
warblers, vireos, and others.</p>

<p>Of all species of North American birds, the Lapland longspur seems
to be the most frequent victim of mass destruction from storms. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">-76-</span>
birds sometimes congregate in enormous numbers where grass or weed
seed is abundant. Almost every winter brings in reports of their
death by thousands somewhere in the Middle West. While migrating
northward at night they have encountered blinding storms of wet,
clinging snow, which have so bewildered them that they have flown
into various obstructions, or have sunk to the ground and perished of
exposure and exhaustion. In 1907 an experienced ornithologist estimated
that 750,000 longspurs were lying dead on the ice of 2 lakes in
Minnesota, each about 1 square mile in extent, and dead birds were
reported in greater or less abundance on this occasion over an area
of more than 1,500 square miles. The heaviest mortality occurred in
towns, where, bewildered by the darkness and the heavy falling snow,
some of the birds congregating in great numbers flew against various
obstacles and were killed or stunned, while many others fell to the
ground exhausted. Similar catastrophes have been reported from
eastern Colorado, Nebraska, and North Dakota.</p>

<p>During the early part of June 1927, a hailstorm of exceptional severity
in and around Denver, Colo., killed large numbers of robins,
meadow larks, sparrows, and others. The lawns of parks were strewn
with the bodies of these birds, and many lay dead in their nests where
they were covering their eggs or young when the storm broke.</p>


<h3 id="Aerial_obstructions">Aerial obstructions</h3>

<p>Lighthouses, lightships, tall bridges, piers, monuments, and other
aerial obstructions have been responsible for a tremendous destruction
of migratory birds. Beams of the lanterns at light stations have a
powerful attraction for nocturnal travelers of the air that may be
likened to the fascination for lights that also is shown by many insects,
particularly night-flying moths. The attraction is not so potent in
clear weather, but when the atmosphere is moisture laden, as in a heavy
fog, the rays have a dazzling effect that lures the birds to their death.
They may fly straight up the beam and dash themselves headlong
against the glass, or they may keep fluttering around the source of the
light until exhausted, and then drop to the rocks or waves below. The
fixed, white, stationary light located 180 feet above sea level at Ponce
de Leon Inlet (formerly Mosquito Inlet), Fla., has caused great destruction
of bird life even though the lens is shielded by wire netting.
On one occasion an observer gathered up a bushel-basketful of warblers,
sparrows, and other small passerine birds that had struck during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">-77-</span>
night. The birds apparently beat themselves to death against the
wire or fell exhausted to the concrete pavement below, frequently
to be destroyed there by cats or skunks. Two other lighthouses at
the southern end of Florida, Sombrero Key and Fowey Rocks, have
been the cause of a great number of bird tragedies, while heavy mortality
has been noted also at some of the lights on the Great Lakes and
on the coast of Quebec. It is the fixed white lights that cause such
disasters to birds, as the stations equipped with flashing or red lights do
not present such strong attractions. That it is not a mere case of geographical
location has been demonstrated, for it is observed that when
fixed white lights have been changed to red or flashing lights, the
migrating birds are no longer endangered. At some of the light stations
in England and elsewhere, shelves and perches have been placed
below the lanterns to afford places where birds can rest until they have
overcome their bewilderment.</p>

<p>For many years at the National Capital, the Washington Monument,
although unilluminated, caused the destruction of large numbers of
small birds, due apparently to their inability to see this obstacle in their
path, towering more than 555 feet into the air. One morning in the
spring of 1902 the bodies of nearly 150 warblers, sparrows, and other
birds were found about its base. Then, as the illumination of the city
was improved and the Monument became more visible at night, the
loss became steadily less, until by 1920 only a few birds would be killed
during an entire migration. On November 11, 1931, however, as part
of the Armistice Day celebration, batteries of brilliant floodlights
grouped on all four sides about the base of the Monument were added
to the two searchlights already trained on the apex, so that the lighted
shaft probably corresponds in brilliancy to a very low magnitude
lighthouse lantern. Airplane pilots have ventured opinions that on
a clear night it could be seen for 40 miles. It is certain that there is
an extensive area of illumination, and on dark nights, when there are
gusty, northerly winds and the nocturnal travelers seem to fly at lower
altitudes, many of them are attracted to the Monument as to a lighthouse
beacon. As they approach from the north a last-minute attempt
to avoid it causes them to veer off to the east or the west where they are
literally sucked in and dashed against the southern face of the shaft.
During the fall migration of 1932 more than 500 warblers, vireos,
thrushes, kinglets, sparrows, and others were killed. Since that year
the mortality has been less, but the Monument at times remains a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">-78-</span>
serious menace to birds during migration and some are killed nearly
every fall.</p>

<p>When the torch on the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor was
kept lighted, it caused an enormous destruction of bird life, tabulations
showing as many as 700 birds killed in a single month.</p>

<p>In September 1948, bird students were startled by news of the wholesale
destruction of Maryland yellowthroats, redstarts, ovenbirds, and
others that were dashed against the 1,250-foot high Empire State Building
in New York City, the 491-foot high Philadelphia Saving Fund
Society Building in Philadelphia, and the 450-foot high WBAL radio
tower in Baltimore. In New York the birds continued to crash into
the Empire State Building over a 6-hour period and their bodies were
scattered over a four-block area. The mortality was so heavy in Philadelphia
that it was impossible to use the sidewalk below the sky-scraper
until the birds had been gathered. A study of the weather
conditions prevailing at this time in the Atlantic coastal region suggests
the probable cause of this catastrophe. By early morning on
September 11 a mass of cold, southward-flowing air had just reached
New York City where it was forcing upward and was being overridden
by a mass of warm, northward-flowing air. Presumably the
migrants were riding the upper levels of the southbound current which,
in the contact zone with the northbound current, was being deflected
earthward, thus causing the birds to fly lower and lower until they
were below the tower of the Empire State Building. Clouds and gusty
winds in the zone of contact between the two air masses reduced visibility
and disrupted avian navigation with the result that the confused
travelers crashed into the stone and steel obstruction. As the cold air
mass continued to move southward, the situation was repeated at

<p>Although it would seem that the exertion incident to the long flights
of many species of migratory birds would result in their arrival at their
destination in a state bordering on exhaustion, this is contrary to the
truth. Both the soaring and the sailing of birds show them to be
proficient in the use of factors employed in aerial transportation that
only recently have become understood and imitated by aeronautical
engineers. The use of ascending currents of air, employed by all soaring
birds, and easily demonstrated by observing the gulls that glide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">-79-</span>
hour after hour along the windward side of a ship, are now utilized
by man in his operation of gliders. Moreover, the whole structure of
a bird renders it the most perfect machine for extensive flight that the
world has ever known. Hollow, air-filled bones, making an ideal
combination of strength and lightness, and the lightest and toughest
material possible for flight in the form of feathers, combine to produce
a perfect flying machine. Mere consideration of a bird's economy of
fuel or energy also is enlightening. The golden plover, traveling
over the oceanic route, makes the entire distance of 2,400 miles from
Nova Scotia to South America without stop, probably requiring about
48 hours of continuous flight. This is accomplished with the consumption
of less than 2 ounces of fuel in the form of body fat. To be as
economical in operation, a 1,000-pound airplane would consume in a
20-mile flight not the gallon of fuel usually required, but only a single
pint.</p>

<p>The sora, or Carolina rail, which is such a notoriously weak flyer that
at least one writer was led to infer that most of its migration was made
on foot, has one of the longest migration routes of any member of the
family, and easily crosses the wide reaches of the Caribbean Sea. The
tiny ruby-throated hummingbird crosses the Gulf of Mexico in a single
flight of more than 500 miles.</p>

<p>While birds that have recently arrived from a protracted flight over
land or sea sometimes show evidences of being tired&mdash;as, for example,
pintail ducks that have flown from the North American mainland to
the Hawaiian Islands&mdash;their condition is far from being a state of exhaustion.
With a few hours' rest and a crop well filled with proper
food, most birds exhibit eagerness to resume their journey. The popular
notion that birds find the long ocean flights excessively wearisome
and that they sink exhausted when terra firma is reached, generally
does not agree with the facts. The truth lies in the opposite direction,
as even small land birds are so little averse to ocean voyages that they
not only cross the Gulf of Mexico at its widest point, but may even pass
without pause over the low, swampy coastal plain to the higher regions
beyond. Under favorable conditions birds can fly when, where, and
how they please. Consequently the distance covered in a single flight
is governed chiefly by the food supply. Exhaustion, except as the result
of unusual factors, cannot be said to be an important peril of
migration.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Influence_of_the_Weather_on_Migration"><i>Influence of the Weather on Migration</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The state of the weather at any point has little if anything to do with
the time of arrival of migratory birds. This is contrary to the belief
of observers who have thought that they could foretell the appearance
of various species by a study of the weather conditions. Though the
insistent crescendo note of the ovenbird is ordinarily associated with
the full verdure of May woods, this bird has been known to reach its
breeding grounds in a snowstorm and the records of its arrival in
southern Minnesota show a temperature variation from near freezing
to full summer warmth. Temperatures at arrival of several other
common birds vary from 14 degrees between highest and lowest temperatures
to 37 degrees, the average variation being about 24 degrees.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that North American species spending the
winter months in tropical latitudes experience no marked changes in
climatic conditions from November to March or April, yet frequently
they will start the northward movement in January or February.
This is in obedience to physiological promptings and has no relation
to the prevailing weather conditions. For migratory birds the winter
season is a period of rest, a time when they have no cares other than
those associated with the daily search for food or escape from their
natural enemies. Their migrations, however, are a vital part of their
life cycles, which have become so well adjusted that the seasons of
travel correspond in general with the major seasonal changes on their
breeding grounds. With the approach of spring, therefore, the reproductive
impulse awakens, and each individual bird is irresistibly impelled
to start the journey that ends in its summer home.</p>

<p>In other words, the evidence indicates that the urge to migrate is
so ingrained that each species moves north in spring when the average
weather that will be encountered is not unendurable. The word
"average" must be emphasized since it appears obvious that the migrations
of birds have so evolved that in general they synchronize with
average climatic conditions. The hardy species travel early, fearless
of the blasts of retreating winter, while the more delicate kinds come
later when there is less danger of encountering prolonged periods of
inclement weather. Some of the hardy birds pause in favorable areas
and allow the spring season to advance. Then, by rapid travel they
again overtake it, or, as sometimes happens, they actually outstrip it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">-81-</span>
Occasionally this results in some hardship, and rarely in the destruction
of large numbers of individuals. Cases are known where early
migrating bluebirds have been overwhelmed by late winter storms.
Nevertheless, unless such climatic conditions are prolonged, no serious
effect on the species is noted. The soundness of the bird's instincts is
evidenced by the fact that natural catastrophes, great though they may
be, do not permanently diminish the avian populations.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out, the advance of average temperature lines,
known as isotherms, is found to correspond closely with the northward
movements of certain species. For example, the northward travels of
the Canada goose are found to coincide with the advance of the isotherm
of 35&deg; F. (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>The spring flight of migrants, if interrupted for any reason, is
resumed when weather conditions again become favorable, and it is
probable that all instances of arrival of birds in stormy weather can
be explained on the theory that the flight was begun while the weather
was auspicious. The state of the weather when a flight starts at any
southern point, the relation of that place to the average position of the
bird under normal weather conditions on that date, and the average
rate of migratory flight, are data basic to any reasonably accurate prediction
of the time arrival may be expected in northern areas.</p>

<p>Head winds are as unfavorable to migration as is rain or snow,
as they greatly increase the labor of flight and cut down the speed of
cross-country travel. If such winds have a particularly high velocity
they may force down the weaker travelers, and when this happens over
water areas, large numbers of birds are lost. Even strong winds that
blow in the direction of aerial travel are unfavorable for the birds, as
they interfere with their balance and disarrange their feathers. Moderate
tail winds and cross or quartering breezes appear to offer the best
conditions for the passage of the migrants.</p>

<h3 id="Banding_studies">Banding studies</h3>

<p>The study of living birds by the banding method, whereby great
numbers of individuals are marked with numbered aluminum leg
rings, has come to be recognized as a most accurate means of ornithological
research. Since 1920, banding work in North America has
been under the direction of the Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">-82-</span>
with the Dominion Wildlife Service of Canada. Every year
voluntary cooperators, working under permit, place bands on thousands
of birds, game and nongame, large and small, migratory and nonmigratory,
each band carrying a serial number and the legend, NOTIFY
FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, WASHINGTON, D. C., or on
the smaller sizes an abbreviation thereof. When a banded bird is
reported from a second locality, a definite fact relative to its movements
becomes known, and a study of many cases of this nature develops
more and more complete knowledge of the details of migration.</p>

<p>The records of banded birds are also yielding other pertinent information
relative to their migrations, such as the exact dates of arrival
and departure of individuals, the length of time that different birds
pause on their migratory journeys to feed and rest, the relation between
weather conditions and the starting times for migration, the
rates of travel of individual birds, the degree of regularity with which
birds return to the exact summer or winter quarters used in former
years, and many other details that could be learned in no other manner.
Banding stations that are operated systematically throughout the year,
therefore, are supplying much information concerning the movements
of migratory birds that heretofore could only be surmised. (See Appendix II,
p. 92 for instructions on reporting the recovery of banded
birds.)</p>


<h3 id="Movements_of_residents">Movements of residents</h3>

<p>Typical migration consists of definite movements that are repeated
regularly year after year, and it is to these that the term is generally
restricted. It is desirable, however, if only for purposes of comparison,
that some account be taken of the movements of some other birds,
which, while not typical, do possess some of the characteristics of true
migration. Data on this subject are being collected through bird
banding.</p>

<p>There are several species that are customarily grouped under the
heading "permanent residents," the term implying that these birds
do not travel but remain throughout the year in one locality. Among
these are the cardinal, the tufted titmouse, the wrentit, the Carolina
wren, the house finch, the bobwhite, the California quail, and the
ruffed grouse. Each species may be present constantly throughout the
year, although in the northern part of the range there is probably a
slight withdrawal of the breeding birds in winter. The individuals to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">-83-</span>
be seen at that season, therefore, may not always be the same as those
observed during the summer. It is certain, however, that these species
do not regularly perform extensive journeys.</p>

<p>While the blue jay is disposed to be secretive, it is such a showy and
noisy bird that it is not likely to escape notice. In the vicinity of
Washington, D. C., as in many other places, it is present the year
round, but at the end of September or early in October when the
weather is becoming cooler, troops of jays are sometimes seen working
southward through the trees. A corresponding northward movement
occurs again in May. This is unquestionably a migration to and from
some winter range, but its extent or significance is not now known.
Some light is being shed on the matter, however, through the records
of banded birds, and these eventually will fill in a more perfect picture
of the movements of this species. One jay, banded on September 14,
1923, at Waukegan, Ill., was killed at Peruque, Mo., on November 15
of the same year; another, banded at Winnetka, Ill., on June 16, 1925,
was retaken at Sulphur Rock, Ark., the following December 10; a
third, banded on May 6, 1925, at Whitten, Iowa, was recaptured at
Decatur, Ark., on January 22, 1926. These three birds unquestionably
had made a flight that had every appearance of being a true migration
to winter quarters in Missouri and Arkansas.</p>

<p>The black-capped chickadee is apparently resident in many places,
but occasionally in winter it invades the range of the southern Carolina
chickadee, and in northern Canada it is regularly a migrant.</p>

<p>In the coastal plain between Washington, D. C., and the Atlantic
Ocean, the white-breasted nuthatch is usually absent during the summer,
nesting at that season in the higher, or piedmont, country. Late
in fall, however, it appears in fair abundance in the wooded bottoms,
remaining at the lower levels until the following March or April.</p>

<p>Some birds, including the screech owl, bobwhite, Carolina wren,
and mockingbird, seem to be actually sedentary, but even these are
sometimes given to post-breeding wanderings. Ordinarily bobwhites
that are marked with numbered bands are seldom retaken far from the
area where banded, but sometimes they will travel 10 miles or more.
A screech owl banded at Glenwood, Minn., in March, was recovered
the following December at Emmetsburg, Iowa, 180 miles south. Such
flights, however, are probably more in the nature of a search for new
feeding areas, or to escape from a winged enemy, than a true migratory
journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">-84-</span></p>


<h3 id="Migration_white-throated_sparrow">Migration of the white-throated sparrow</h3>

<p>The white-throated sparrow, one of the most abundant members
of its family, breeds from northern Mackenzie and the southern part of
the Ungava Peninsula south to southern Montana, northern Pennsylvania,
and Massachusetts. The winter range extends from the southern
part of the breeding range south to the Gulf coast and northeastern
Mexico. It is therefore a common migrant in many sections. Since
it is a ground-feeding bird and is readily attracted to the vicinity of
dwellings, it has been banded in large numbers, the total to November
14, 1949, being nearly 283,500. It would be expected that these would
yield a comparable number of return records that would furnish
basic data relative to the migrations of the species. Such, however, is
not the case. Banded white-throated sparrows are rarely recaptured
at stations between the breeding and wintering grounds. Operators of
stations in the winter area, as Thomasville, Ga., and Summerville, S. C.,
have obtained return records showing that these birds do come back
to the exact winter quarters occupied in previous seasons. The fact
that they do not again visit banding stations on their migration routes
indicates some unusual aspects of their travels, which it is hoped will
eventually be discovered by banding studies. Problems of this type
constitute definite challenges to the student of bird migration.</p>


<h3 id="Migration_yellow-billed_loon">Migration of the yellow-billed loon</h3>

<p>The semiannual movements of the yellow-billed loon present an
unusual problem in migration. It breeds along the Arctic coast, probably
from Cape Prince of Wales eastward to Franklin Bay, and also
in the interior of northern Canada south to Clinton-Colden, Aylmer,
and Artillery Lakes, where it is rather common. It has been reported
as already present by May 25 at the mouth of the Liard River, in southwestern
Mackenzie. This coincides with the time that first arrivals
are noted fully 700 miles north, at Point Barrow, Alaska. The problem
has been to ascertain the route used by these birds to their principal
nesting grounds in the interior.</p>

<p>For a long time it was believed that this big diver did not winter
in large numbers anywhere on the Pacific coast, and it had been supposed
that the spring route extended 2,000 miles northeastward from a
wintering ground somewhere in eastern Asia to Bering Strait, then
500 miles still northeast to round Point Barrow, then 500 miles east to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">-85-</span>
the coast of Mackenzie, and finally 700 miles south&mdash;in spring&mdash;to the
region near the eastern end of Great Slave Lake.</p>

<p>The yellow-billed loon is a powerful flier, and it is probable that
this suggested route is correct for those birds that breed in the northern
coastal regions. A reasonable doubt may be entertained, however,
whether the breeding birds of Great Slave Lake and contiguous areas
reach their breeding grounds by the 700-mile flight south from the
Arctic coast. Within recent years it has been found that these birds
are fairly common in the maze of channels and islands off the coast of
southeastern Alaska as late as the last of October and in February.
Possibly they are present there during the period from November
through January also, or they may at that time move farther off shore
and so escape detection. If this region is an important wintering
ground, as seems probable, then it is likely that the breeding birds of
the interior reach their nesting grounds by a flight eastward across
the mountains, a trip that is well within their flying ability, rather than
by a circuitous route around the northern coast. The air-line distance
from southeastern Alaska to the mouth of the Liard River is in fact
less than the distance to that point from the mouth of the Mackenzie.</p>

<p>Differing routes to various parts of a large breeding or wintering
ground, and used by large groups of individuals of other species, are
not unknown. For example, the redhead duck is one of the common
breeding ducks of the Bear River marshes of Utah, where a great many
have been banded each summer. The recovery records of banded redheads
show that while many travel westward to California, others
start their fall migration in the opposite direction and, flying eastward
across the Rocky Mountains, either turn southeast across the plains
to the Gulf of Mexico, or deliberately proceed in a northeasterly direction
to join the flocks of this species moving toward the Atlantic coast
from the prairie regions of southern Canada.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="Conclusions"><i>Conclusions</i></h2>
</div>


<p>The migration of birds as it is known today had its beginning in
times so remote that its origins have been entirely obscured, and it
can be interpreted now only in terms of present conditions. The
causes underlying migration are exceedingly complex. The mystery
that formerly cloaked the periodic travels of birds, however, has been
largely dispelled through the fairly complete information that is now
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">-86-</span>
available concerning the extent and times of the seasonal journeys of
most of the species. Many gaps, however, still remain in our knowledge
of the subject. Much has been learned, and present knowledge
is being placed on record, but it must be left to future study to clear
away many of the uncertainties that continue to make bird migration
one of the most fascinating subjects in the science of ornithology.</p>

<p>Each kind of bird seems to have its own reaction to its environment,
so that the character of movement differs widely in the various species,
and seldom do any two present the same picture. In fact, bird migration
has been described as a phase of geographic distribution wherein
there is a more or less regular seasonal shifting of the avian population
caused by the same factors that determine the ranges of the sedentary
species. If this view is correct, then it must be recognized that the far-reaching
works of man in altering the natural condition of the earth's
surface can so change the environment necessary for the well-being of
the birds as to bring about changes in their yearly travels. The nature
and extent of the changes wrought by man on the North American
Continent are easily apparent. Forests have been extensively cut away
and their places have been taken by second growth or cultivated land,
and wide stretches of prairie and plain have been broken up, irrigated,
and devoted to agriculture. These great changes are exerting a profound
effect upon the native bird populations, and the various species
may be either benefited or adversely affected thereby.</p>

<p>The Federal Government has recognized its responsibility to the
migratory birds under changing conditions brought about by man,
and by enabling acts for carrying out treaty obligations, it is now giving
most species legal protection under regulations administered by the
Fish and Wildlife Service. Much is being done by legislation for the
welfare of the birds. The effectiveness of these conservation laws,
however, is increased in the same measure that the people of the country
become acquainted with the facts in the life histories of the migrants
and interest themselves personally in the well-being of the various
species. Long before the white man came to America the birds had
established their seasonal lanes of migration throughout the Western
Hemisphere. The economic, inspirational, and esthetic values of these
migratory species dictate that they be permitted to continue their long-accustomed
and still-mysterious habits of migration from clime to
clime.</p>

</div>


<p>Frequent reference has been made in this bulletin to bird banding as
a means for obtaining information on the migrations and life histories
of birds. Since 1920 this work in North America has been under the
direction of the Fish and Wildlife Service in cooperation with the
Dominion Wildlife Service of Canada. Each year birds to the number
of a quarter of a million or more may be marked with numbered bands.</p>

<p>As anyone interested in birds, either game or nongame, may have
a marked individual come into his hands, there are several pertinent
details that should be remembered if the recovery record is to have
maximum value in advancing the science of ornithology.</p>

<p>1. The reporting letter should be addressed to: Bird Banding Office,
Patuxent Research Refuge, Fish and Wildlife Service, Laurel, Md.</p>

<p>2. In the letter print the full number of the band, including the
series designation and the serial number. The series designation may
be a single letter or a two- or three-digit number and may be stamped
to the left or over the serial number. The series designation, if a number
such as "48" or "50," is not a date and should not be so interpreted.
Full numbers are correctly written as: A-678901; 48-345920; 141-543678;
20-167; 496-00517; etc.</p>

<p>3. If the bird is alive and uninjured, read the number carefully without
removing the band, and release the bird. It may be reported again.
If it is dead, remove the band and, after flattening it out, attach it to
the letter with scotch tape or surgical adhesive tape. Should it be
desired as a souvenir, it will be returned upon request.</p>

<p>4. Give in the report the exact date, the location (town, county,
State, etc.) and the manner in which the bird was obtained, that is,
whether it was shot, found dead, trapped, etc.</p>

<p>5. Print your own name and permanent address clearly on the
letter.</p>

<p>6. Keep a record of the band number and refer to it should there
be any subsequent correspondence about it with the Service. The
number is always the clue to any record of a banded bird.</p>

<p>Some bands may bear the inscription "Notify F. and Wildlife Service,
Washington, D. C." or "Notify Biological Survey, Washington,
D. C.," and on the smaller sizes these may be abbreviated to "F. and
W. Serv. Wash. D. C." or "Biol. Surv. Wash. D. C."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">-93-</span></p>

<p>All reports of the recovery of banded birds will be acknowledged
with the name of the bird, the date and place where it was banded,
and the name and address of the bander.</p>

<p>The banding of birds is done by regular officers of the United States
and Dominion Services, by biologists and technicians of the States and
Provinces, and by volunteer cooperators who are specially licensed
under the provisions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The banding
of migratory waterfowl is largely restricted to Federal and State officers
and is done chiefly in refuge areas. Most nongame birds are
banded by volunteer cooperators who are scattered over the United
States, Canada, and Alaska. The bands are furnished without charge
by the Service but each station operator supplies his own traps and
other equipment.</p>

<p>To participate in this work, certain rules must be adhered to. Applicants
for banding permits:</p>

<p>1. Must be at least 18 years of age.</p>

<p>2. Must be thoroughly competent to identify positively all local
birds.</p>

<p>3. Must have their ability vouched for by three recognized ornithologists
or by other banders.</p>

<p>Application blanks for the Federal permits required may be obtained
from the Bird Banding Office, Patuxent Research Refuge, Fish and
Wildlife Service, Laurel, Md., or, in Canada, from the Chief, Dominion
Wildlife Service, Ottawa, Ontario.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
